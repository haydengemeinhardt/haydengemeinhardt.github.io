	“Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them. This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these children. Stick to Facts, sir!”</p><p>	Coming into this book, I dearly wish I knew the information I knew now, though the research serves as a post-excitement after finishing it, like the chocolate at the bottom of a Nestle drumstick (of which is very much related to how felt about Dostoyevsky’s The Idiot, though that was a lot longer and less poetic of a book).</p><p>	Hard Times is one of Charles Dickens’s more philosophical books with a stronger message than plot, which often receives a lot of criticism from fans accustomed to his usual style. It was published in the second half of his career that follows more of this “message above plot” style than his first half. </p><p>It is important to take note of society at this time that the book is set in. Industrial England was by no means a happy-go-lucky type of society. The common-man factory worker had long hours, meager pay, unflattering homes, and often poor family life. During this time, utilitarianism was an increasingly popular ideology-- the doctrine that finds the right actions to be those that bring about the most happiness for the most people.</p><p>	The book is aimed at unsympathetically attacking utilitarianism. Dickens considered it a selfish philosophy of over rationalization, over rationalization being a key word there. He believed it over emphasized facts and too often put fact over fancy. You can see the exaggeration of this ideology in the first paragraph of the book (at the top) and all throughout, portrayed through the likes of Mr. Gradgrind (a play-on of graduation and grinding as he is a school master) and Mr. Bounderby (a play-on of a bounder, and who is “perfectly devoid of sentiment”). And in an exchange towards the end, one person says “If this is solely a question of self interest with you—” and the other replies, “I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest.”</p><p>There’s a couple of things to point out with the introduction:</p><p>	First (and this is what stuck out to me the most) was the use of metaphorical language by Mr. Gradgrind to show the importance of facts. At first, I thought it was a mistake, but Dickens is too masterful at his craft for that. Instead, it’s a very clever rhetorical use of words. Dickens has a way with words that I characterize as poetical.</p><p>Secondly, the book vigorously attacks the education system during that time. It was a system that not only created a deep divide and lack of respect between the factory workers and owners, but also strongly emphasized facts while neglecting imagination. This is made clear from page one.</p><p>	Lastly, and this is the much bigger point, the paragraph is a hyperbolized representation of utilitarianism (plant nothing else, and root out everything else). Dickens is known for his use of hyperbole to get his point across, which is interesting considering it is in a time that hyperbole is seen as an adolescent rhetorical tool (it’s the most common critique of his work). But it fits so, so perfectly with the message of the story.</p><p>	As Professor Belinda Jack puts it in her lecture found here, she states, “The hyperbole associated with facts and figures goes beyond the straight forwardly comic and trivial. It serves to point to the ideological defects of utilitarianism and similar ideologies and points to new and exciting ideological possibilities if we can get beyond facts and figures.”</p><p>	An immediate tangible manifestation of hyperbole is presented in the circus. A circus is known to be an exaggeration of normal life with performances that go beyond what we perceive as normal. It’s a literal hyperbole (and Dickens brilliantly describes it with hyperboles. A hyperbole of a hyperbole. The most Dickens thing ever!). Dicks was actually a big fan of circuses and commonly visited the Astley Circus which, fun fact, is credited for the idea of circling the audience around the performance.</p><p>The circus, a metonymy as the bastion of fancy, is contrasted against Coketown, a town of nothing but coal and smoke similar to that of 19th century Manchester or Preston that is devoid of anything but fact. It’s quite possibly the greatest use of contrast in any of the books that I have ever read. I really love it.</p><p>In this town, the workers are referred to as hands (not people), no more than vulnerable appendages to the machines they work, and they are represented through a man called Stephen Blackpool. The only reason I bring up his name is to point out my favorite scene in the entire book, and definitely a favorite overall any book.</p><p>This is a kind of spoiler (not really, but I’ll hide it anyway). Hover to reveal: Stephen has a drunken wife that randomly returns to his house one day. While he is sleeping in his chair, a girl who he plans on marrying one day, Rachel, is watching over his current wife. Stephen is dreaming when he (somewhat) awakes to his drunken wife about to drink from a bottle of medicine labeled “poison”. He wonders if he is dreaming or not (it being characterized as a half-dream adds on so much to the picture), and finds himself unable to stop his wife from drinking the poison. Rachel then wakes and stops her from drinking it, and Stephen calls her an angel. He then later asks Bounderby how to get a divorce and Bounderby says it is a complicated and expensive legal proceeding (showing how the rich have different rules than the poor).</p><p>This one is a spoiler, but I can’t help but mention it if you don’t plan on reading the book: Louisa gets married to Bounderby who is 30 years older than her (again, exaggerated instead of using 10 or 20 years), and her father justifies it using facts and statistics. Bounderby starts calling her Loo like Tom does and it makes me die inside every time I see it. I can’t even put it into words how much I hated it. The first time I saw it, I literally put the book down and went for a run.</p><p>Another critique of the book is that it’s very melodramatic, though I guess I’ll be the odd man out from the way more intellectual critics and say it doesn’t seem that way to me. Most of the “melodramatic” reactions mentioned seemed reasonable to me, at least within a story.</p><p>All in all, this read like a 4/6 book without this information, but if I had gone into the book after reading this review, I’d easily give it a 5/6.
