<p>Some children grow up without ever seeing snow. They see it in movies and textbooks and believe it exists, maybe even played under an artificial snow machine at a Christmas light show, but Christmas or winter itself was not characterized by snow.</p>
<p>I grew up without ever knowing what help from a stranger was like. I saw it in newspapers when such a rare event would happen, but I never experienced it myself. The concept was foreign.</p>
<p>As such, I did not believe Velorez when she insisted that she would help me. I imagined by “help”, she meant she would gently cuff me instead of tazing me. Maybe mark on the police report that I should see a therapist once before I went to prison. She did cuff me gently, and escorted me to the back of her police cruiser softly, but then she said, “Hold on,” and turned back to the house.</p>
<p>“Wait!” I called. She turned around and I asked, “Can I call someone?”</p>
<p>Velorez pulled out her own phone, unlocked it, and handed it to me. “I’ll be back shortly.”</p>
<p>She had done something that no other stranger had ever done for me. Not only had she helped me, but she trusted me in a situation where she had absolutely every reason not to, where all protocol, instinct, and rationality would tell her otherwise. With a single action, I knew that she knew something everyone else missed. I wanted to know what that was.</p>
<p>I could have scoured her phone or snuck into her house in search of answers. An answer as important as that should have been worth the trouble. It wasn’t, because I realized what everyone else knew. I learned that which was honor. That which I lost all of in a single night. It was to become bedridden sick and realize how important being healthy was.</p>
<p>I called who I thought was the most honorable man I knew, someone who could take care of the situation for me, as a bedridden, sick man does. </p>
<p>I explained to Bobby everything that happened. He arrived before Velorez returned. I watched through the bars of the backseat window as Bobby rushed into the house—with someone letting him in, that is. A few minutes later, they both came out. </p>
<p>Velorez opened the cruiser door for Bobby. His eyes were red and watery. “Why did you do this?” He asked.</p>
<p>I looked to my knees. The shame was unbearable. It was more unbearable than anything else. Yes, even more than loss of the best friend that I let define my life. It was the weight of my world on my shoulders, waiting for me to make it right, for it was worsened at no fault but my own this time.</p>
<p>Bobby slammed his hand against the top of the car. “Can you at least look at me?”</p>
<p>Velorez tugged me out of the vehicle. Then she uncuffed me and motioned for me to face Bobby.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said. “It was a terrible mistake.”</p>
<p>“You are not a child,” he said. “You’re not going to the principal’s office. You’re going to jail.”</p>
<p>When Velorez said she would help me and then uncuffed me, there was hope that the family understood me and dropped the charges. Bobby made it clear that was not the case. </p>
<p>There was a world where I failed to get into Valencia, one that was difficult to accept as it had not yet happened. The world that would maim my life to mediocrity. And then there was a world where I went to prison, where a mediocre life would become the new dream. Nothing was easier to believe. The indents in my wrist demanded it of me.</p>
<p>I promised myself that I would do anything to avoid a life like that, for the life I had was worth everything I had to give. Everything succumbed to my existence. I was all in. So why would I fold my hand before the final card was revealed? When the chance for the greatest story lied before me? </p>
<p>I hugged Bobby tight and whispered in his ear, “Forgive me.” When we pulled apart, I lunged through the gap between him and Velorez.</p>
<p>Velorez’s hand grasped at my shirt, but I was too fast. She didn’t know who I was. I was Mickey fucking Lee. With George gone, no one in all of Newport could run faster than me. </p>
<p>No one in all of Newport knew the area like I did either. They drove through the streets in cars and walked the sidewalks near their homes. They didn’t study the layout of the homes around trees and hills and parks because they didn’t run for miles every day through every possible path with nothing more to think about than which routes would be best to escape a car pursuit by foot.</p>
<p>Before I even lunged, I knew exactly which route to take and with which pace. I followed the path quickly and precisely. To any untrained eye, no path was more twisted, but it was really a straight line to the dam where I could jump and become lost in the dark, deep waters.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I waded at the other end of the lake for two hours. No blue lights flickered across the bridge. No flashlights shone around the shore. There was no chase. What a shame.</p>
<p>My house wasn’t far. I climbed the shoreline and jogged home. There were no cops waiting outside. With my house still dark, it was easy to sneak through the backyard and backdoor. I was careful not to wake my dad as I crept up the stairs and into my bed.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The doorbell rang. Flint barked. I rubbed my eyes and checked the time on my phone. Who rings doorbells at 11 A.M. on a Tuesday? I could only assume the police came to pick me up.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang again and Flint barked some more. I threw myself out of bed and peeked through the curtains. There were no police vehicles outside, only Hugo’s car. I sighed and lumbered down the stairs. Flint stood at the door, piercing my ears with incessant barking.</p>
<p>“Flint!”</p>
<p>Flint stopped. I opened the door and squinted in the sunlight. Hugo paused halfway to the doorbell.</p>
<p>“How do you know where I live?” I asked. “And what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“I’m getting you out of bed.”</p>
<p>“I’m out. But I’m not going to school today if that’s what you’re trying to do.”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” he said. “Although Fritz was looking for you.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t care.”</p>
<p>“I know. I expected you to be grumpy. I also expected you to close the door on me by now.”</p>
<p>“Well, I expected you to bash it open if I tried.”</p>
<p>“You are correct,” he said, pushing the door further open. “I am willing to risk our entire friendship on getting you out of the house today.”</p>
<p>Hugo wasn’t Bobby. I never had to prove to Hugo anything. He never tried to make me a better person. He was being a friend to lean on until I could figure it out for myself. Yet, the hardest thing was allowing myself to be helped. It required a commitment of energy, of which I had none. It required being vulnerable around those you aren’t used to being vulnerable around. It required admitting that I was wrong or incapable of helping myself.</p>
<p>I did not want to do any of those things, but what I did not want to do, above all else, was to throw away that which the passing time brought me—today, that was Hugo at my doorstep.</p>
<p>Hugo welcomed himself into my home and closed the door behind him. “Why is it so cold in here?”</p>
<p>“My dad likes it cold when he sleeps,” I said.</p>
<p>It was approximately forty five degrees.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I didn’t know where Hugo planned on driving me to, but I was not expecting to cross town into a driveway that I assumed was his own. He stopped the car and led me inside.</p>
<p>It was a smaller house, like George’s, but older. The roof was lower to the ground. The floor near the entrance was of smaller, textured, and slightly uneven tiles with thick spacing unlike the lush ones of newer homes. Towards the living room were wooden floors, but the wood was worn and lacked a seamless finish. The furniture was older, likely from before my and Hugo’s times. Seemingly random ornaments and family pictures decorated walls and shelves. A small fish tank rested on a table near the entrance, its filter churning in the silence. The smell of a wonderful meal permeated the air.</p>
<p>“Hey Mom,” Hugo called, “Mickey’s here.”</p>
<p>His mother rushed out from a side room where the smell arose and embraced me with open arms. “How are you doing, sweetheart?” she asked. “I’ve heard all about you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you have?”</p>
<p>“Mom, please don’t embarrass our guest.”</p>
<p>“I’m hardly embarrassed.”</p>
<p>“Come,” she said, “I have food for you.”</p>
<p>“Shower first,” Hugo interrupted, and he led me down a narrow hallway that was really only wide enough for one person at a time. He stopped at a doorway and flicked the light on inside the room, as well as a vent fan, then stepped aside for me to enter. “Towels are in the closet. The water should get very hot very quickly. Leave the vent on.” He turned to leave, but left one more comment, “Oh, and my mom’s name is Maya, but I just call her Mom.”</p>
<p>I nodded and shut the door.</p>
<p>The shower got very hot. I let it burn my skin. I could have stayed in the shower all day, but I could smell the food. I washed quickly and rinsed my body with cold water before drying and redressing and exiting the bathroom.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, Hugo was sitting at a table chatting to his mom about schoolwork and teachers, and how things were so much different at his old school. His mom nodded as she leaned against the counter. On the table in front of Hugo, there was a half-eaten bowl of soup, and a full bowl at an empty seat across the table. The soup was orange, with chicken, corn, beans, tomatoes, onions, and peppers piled just above the surface of the broth.</p>
<p>“Please, sit and eat,” Hugo’s mom said. “I have more if you are still hungry.”</p>
<p>I sat across from Hugo and felt the sides of the bowl. It warmed my hands.</p>
<p>Hugo’s mom brought me a cup of tea and a cup of water and set them next to the bowl. Then she poured the last of a bottle of orange juice into a cup and set it next to the others. I fished a spoonful of soup and tasted its delight, and the spice immediately made me realize why I was brought a cup of orange juice.</p>
<p>“You thank Hugo for that orange juice,” his mom said. “He thinks it’s the best thing in the world, and he insisted you have what we had left.”</p>
<p>Hugo shook his head. “Mom, now you’re just going to make him feel bad.”</p>
<p>The doorbell rang. Goosebumps rolled across my skin.</p>
<p>His mom wiped her hands with a rag. “Mickey, there’s more if you want. Eat,” she said, then left to answer the door.</p>
<p>“So,” I said, “did you invite Megan over too?”</p>
<p>“Megan isn’t who you need right now.”</p>
<p>The voices emanated from the front door: one, of Hugo’s mom, and two, remnant of my past. Not of yesterday’s past. Rather, the love-hate that meandered in the background of my life. The piece of my life that I lost hope in reconnecting, for it was like removing a primary hue of color from the world and expecting a painting to be just as beautiful, and to leave it hanging on the wall. Yet, there came my living counterpart walking into the kitchen, demanding my recognition of existence.</p>
<p>“Lucas—” my voice trailed off in confusion of what tone to adopt. Was I to be angry for him having pushed Jenny over the edge? Or to be ecstatic to see someone I had not the dignity to embrace? But like all things in life, I hesitated, and the slight period of time that passed let Lucas set the tone for me.</p>
<p>“How are you doing?” Lucas asked.</p>
<p>“Horrendous,” I said with a smile and rose to hug him.</p>
<p>“Just so you know,” he said, pulling away, “she’s okay. She’s going to be fine.”</p>
<p>My body, from my toes up through my heart and brain, lit with joy like a Christmas tree. I tried to hide it, but no thickness of a tarp that could cover an ornamented tree could hide the wave of energy that flowed when the switch was clicked. One just felt it, without knowing how. The microscopic adjustments that we evolved to sense amongst ourselves that alien species could never detect and that we could never miss. Like a paradigm that only we could understand. The uncomfortable reality of the suit of flesh that our spirit operated, that needed soup to survive.</p>
<p>Hugo excused himself to give us some privacy, so I led Lucas back to the table where my soup remained unfinished. I shoveled another spoonful down my throat. Despite likely being the last good meal I would get before going to jail, it had transformed into simply fuel for my excitement.</p>
<p>Lucas never asked for a bowl, but I went searching the cabinets for one anyway. When I found a bowl, I poured an excess amount of soup into it, and set it in front of Lucas. He seemed uncomfortable with my scrummaging around Hugo’s cabinets; it wasn’t a side of me he had seen before. I continued regardless and gave him a spoon and a glass of water and told him to share lunch with me.</p>
<p>We caught up on each other’s lives. We laughed and gasped until the soup became shallow. Then I took both of our bowls to the sink and rinsed them out and refilled both of our waters. A long enough pause ensued that only then did the topic at hand swell out.</p>
<p>I set the glasses on the table and sat back down across from him. “You know,” I said, “none of it felt real yesterday.”</p>
<p>Lucas took a drink from the glass and set it in a more natural place for himself. “You realize you said the same thing about George, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure I only ever told Jenny that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, Jenny and I talk.”</p>
<p>“I saw.”</p>
<p>Lucas tilted his head in confusion. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>I hadn’t intended to bring up the conversation like that, but it was too late. My heart already clenched its vexation. The thought Jenny would be fine if it wasn’t for you paced my head. “I saw you two talking yesterday. What was that all about?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” he said, and leaned back in his seat. “There’s more than you know.”</p>
<p>“You remember how you pushed her to the ground, and she ran home in tears while you walked away? What part of the context am I missing?”</p>
<p>Lucas crossed his arms and looked away in anger. He gave a ‘so this is how it’s going to be’ sigh. “Yes, I messed up. She slapped me and said some pretty nasty things, and I lost my temper.”</p>
<p>“Jenny slapped you?”</p>
<p>He nodded. “I was just as surprised as you are. I didn’t realize until the adrenaline wore off why she might’ve done that. You still have every right to be mad, as I am myself. But like I said, there’s more than you know that I think might be best to leave behind.”</p>
<p>Even though Lucas and I hadn’t talked for a month, I had still known him our whole lives. I knew who he was. I knew he made mistakes, but they were never because he was a bad person. If we ever got in fights—and we did a lot as kids—we’d yell at each other, but the next day, life would go on. Our friendship was worth more than our pride.</p>
<p>I only doubted Lucas because I doubted that our friendship remained. It was irrevocably tainted. Nearly beyond repair. Hardly a word passed between us. He could have transformed into a different, very cruel and spiteful person without my knowing, as would be expected of one who lost another dear to them. After all, I was not the same, so how could I expect him to be? Yet, from my perspective, he was still the same Lucas, as affected by George as I was: hurt, but ready to move on.</p>
<p>Before I could continue my barrage, he said, “I saw you too. Not that day, but a while back.”</p>
<p>“Which day?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It was the last time you came over to my house. You rang the doorbell, but I didn’t feel like talking to anyone. Not even you.” He paused and shook his head. “You rang twice before leaving, and then I watched you from a window as you crossed the street and walked up the driveway of another house.”</p>
<p>Was that why he avoided me?</p>
<p>I looked to my hands, sheltering my eyes from his leer. It wasn’t a rumor bounced between classrooms, twisted from half-truth to outright lie that makes you jump when it’s about you. No, truth doesn’t startle like a lie. It freezes you. It makes you feel cold, naked, and vulnerable, and you do everything you can to avoid looking it in the eye as you feel its gaze upon you.</p>
<p>What was I to say? Could my hesitation let the topic slip away like everything else? But it didn’t. A moment had passed and Lucas waited patiently. My mind became so focused on finding an answer that it only thought about itself finding an answer instead of finding the answer itself, so time passed with nothing to show. But why did I have to look for an answer, when the answer was all I ever contemplated?</p>
<p>Yet, the only thing more shameful than what I did would be to lie about it or hide it. I did it for a reason—a very thought out reason—and to not fill in Lucas on the context would be to say that I was scared to explain my own reasoning. That I was scared of who I was. To be unable to express myself to the world. To let the world dictate my path instead of taking it myself. Or to be ashamed of the path that I was currently taking, which meant that it was the wrong path after all. That was happening an awful lot.</p>
<p>I remembered what Hugo told me: “If you don’t spread the truth, then someone will for you.” There was no hiding my going to prison, or my flight from the city, whichever path I would take. Some truth would fill the void.</p>
<p>I admitted to Lucas, “That wasn’t the only one either.”</p>
<p>“Are you fucking serious?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I said, and then explained to him everything: the desire for stories like George, during an application season that demanded it; the adrenaline that made me feel alive, when suicide became romanticized; the excuse that had no one known anything happened at all, then it was not wrong; and my aversion towards the rich that transformed into something that had nothing to do with the rich at all, yet remained as spite that justified my case. </p>
<p>It was easier knowing that the truth was inevitably going to come out. But I did not tell him about last night.</p>
<p>He let the revelation settle in constant sighs and shakes of the head, in hundred-yard-stares and laughs and running of his fingers through his hair. “You’re a weird, crazy son of a bitch,” he said. “Promise me that life is behind you.”</p>
<p>“I promise,” I lied.</p>
<p>“Then that’s that, I guess,” he said. “You got your story like you wanted. How does it feel?”</p>
<p>Only when I allowed myself to be honest did I realize that the path I had taken after George’s passing in fact brought me full circle. I passed through the same thorny bushes that still had the old chords of my heart they plucked off in my first passing months ago, the thorny branches that twisted around my bare feet until any step I took was the wrong one. Time had passed; no progress was made.</p>
<p>Maybe the circumstances were due to no fault of my own, but my actions, my mindset, and my consequences were.</p>
<p>“It’s not the story I want to tell,” I said. “I want to tell the next one that I have yet to find or experience.”</p>
<p>“There’s one story waiting for you,” Lucas said. “She’s in the hospital right now, probably looking out the window waiting for your car to come down the road.”</p>
<p>I downed the glass of water and rose from the chair.</p>
<p>“You can’t go now though,” he said, “you need her family to take you.”</p>
<p>“I know, but in the meantime, I’m going to give this all another try.”</p>
<p>“Give what another try?”</p>
<p>“Life,” I said. “I was so close, Lucas. So very close to it being within my grasp. But I know what I need to do, and I’m not going to find it here.”</p>
