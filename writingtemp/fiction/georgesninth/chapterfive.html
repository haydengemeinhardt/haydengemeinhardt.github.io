<p>I had a dream last night. A beguiling dream complemented with all the absurdities dreams embody.</p>
<p>When I found my feet planted in the world my mind conjured up for the night, everyone had vanished without a trace. In a normal world, I would have lost my mind. In this one, there was no fear or worry or loneliness because I had not fully comprehended what it all meant, for as much as I knew, the world had taken vacation off on some spaceship and I either missed my alarm or was entrusted to watch over the Earth in their leave—both theories just absurd enough to fit into the dream. I think the only normal thing was my mind did not hint at continuing life as usual even if it was possible. So instead of focusing on the loneliness, my mind crossed the boundaries of the society that were previously forbidden to cross.</p>
<p>One thing I remembered as a kid was that the older I got, the more of the world opened up to me. That each year, the constraints were loosened just a little more. Soon I’d be able to stay out after dark. Then I could shed the bed time. Then I could drive myself anywhere I wanted. Then I could tell an adult to fuck off whenever I wanted. It was a lot like that.</p>
<p>Except these boundaries were taboo and universal. These boundaries stop us from going places we cannot go. If those boundaries disappeared, would your curiosity not be piqued? To roam the White House or a billionaire’s Manhattan penthouse or the Lascaux cave or Vatican secret archives?</p>
<p>The only problem was, without anyone in the world, the logistics of doing so were quite limited. So, I settled for a more mundane approach.</p>
<p>There was a place I passed by on the bus daily in middle school that always captured my imagination. Unlike the cold, modern homes that lined the streets, this house was cozy and old. It was recessed behind a black-steel fence whose columns were made of red brick. Behind that was a blossoming garden that instead of hiding the home’s difference, only made it more intriguing. And behind that lied the three story manor, with windows at different heights and a tower on its corner. The kind of home you’d imagine Miss Peregrine to own. It fancied all the adorations I had as a kid.</p>
<p>In my dream, the house had a grand entrance with a bisecting wooden staircase under a crystal chandelier. There was a haunted library that seemed to always have rain pounding against its windows. Atop was an attic full of antiques that grandchildren would play dress up in and pretend to live from a different age. Art worthy of a museum adorned the walls. Homemade sweets stockpiled the kitchen. In an old guestroom, a dusty wardrobe led to another world where time stopped. And I just knew that there had to be a hidden room somewhere.</p>
<p>I was equally excited and anxious. Excited to be exploring this house of my childhood fantasies and anxious out of fear everyone would reappear while I was still rummaging through the house that I didn’t belong in--which did end up happening. The police swarmed the house and my mind struggled to accept that my life was forever changed.</p>
<p>I woke up in a hot sweat. After a moment, my heart slowed from the anxiety-induced adrenaline rush. It had quite literally felt like I went on an adventure.</p>
<p>Contrasting it with the life I had just come from--school, work, run, homework, sleep, repeat—the adrenaline rush was surreal. I had not felt that extreme of an emotion in too long. Life had gone from dull to thrilling at the snap of a finger.</p>
<p>Inevitably, proceeding through the nuances of the day at the shop, my enthralled mind desired to be in that dream again. Working on cars let my mind escape from the depressing world, but that dream let me actually experience the world.</p>
<p>From the corner of my eye I noticed Jenny strolling my way. Her hair was lackadaisically wrapped into a bun and her t-shirt was baggy and worked with wrinkles. “You tired too?” Jenny asked, rubbing her eyes in the morning sun.</p>
<p>She caught me blankly replacing a trunk latch that had been recalled. “Kind of. Just distracted. What’s up?”</p>
<p>“I need you to pull that car around for me.” She pointed to a white Datsun out front. “Another manual.”</p>
<p>I slammed the trunk shut and set my tools on the bench. “Wanna take over here for me then?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” she said, tossing me the key. “Matter of fact, I am vehemently against it.”</p>
<p>“Then why not get someone else to do it?”</p>
<p>“Because I like telling you what to do. Now stop stalling and go pull the car around.”</p>
<p>Caught in the act. She never would let me pry too deep. Back to her usual self. </p>
<p>But oh-ho I was far from stalling. The manuals of Newport weren’t manuals because they were old; if they were old, they weren’t old because they were cheap. These were Sunday morning cars that every God-loving Newportian would splurge on in the name of charity. I could only presume it was because their benevolent god encouraged almsgiving in the form of trickle-down economics.</p>
<p>I lowered myself into the car, shut the door, and twisted the key. The engine spurred to a mesmerizing life, yet I kept thinking about that dream having stepped into someone’s car. It wasn’t quite the same. But I longed for the thrill. And between that and a newfound disgust for materialism, I snagged a piece of their gum. It was… oddly thrilling. The most mundane of thrills. Twice removed from the dream. It meant nothing. Nothing more than rolling your window down and flipping someone off in traffic or lying about feeling fine or holding the door open for someone. Yet were those not foundations of social norms? That sparked something, no matter how little, in your heart. That’s what stealing that gum did for me. No thought other than “hmm, what an interesting feeling” and a desire in the back of the mind to take it a step further.</p>
<p>I popped the gum in my mouth and enjoyed the sweet mint release. My middle finger to this rich asshole. I drove it around and parked it in the spot where Jenny worked, turned off the car, and handed Jenny the key as I got out. </p>
<p>“Bobby wants to talk to you by the way.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, maybe his dog or something.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. Jenny was still a little grumpy. I caught sight of Bobby on the other side of the garage, looking into the hood of a truck next to Daniel who was pointing at various parts. Bobby reached in and finagled a piece, then looked to Daniel who shook his head and pointed some more. By the time I got there, Bobby was two hands deep in the hood.</p>
<p>“You needed something, Bobby?”</p>
<p>“In a few minutes,” he grunted, pulling out a piece of the car, “we’re going out for a ride. We’ll be out all day too, so bring your lunch.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>He straightened and took a breath. “I’ll tell you on the way. Just grab your stuff and we’ll leave in a minute.”</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, I was in the passenger’s seat of Bobby’s truck cruising over the crest of Paula Bridge. Paula Bridge was one of the main bridges that crossed the river bisecting Newport and segregating it accordingly.</p>
<p>I had only been across it a handful of times as a kid. As the innocent kid I was, I’d look behind us at the picturesque embodiment of Newport: a cluster of newly-built highrises, a shore lined with sandy beaches and docks, and wealthy homes stretching into the hills.</p>
<p>Now, I only saw what laid across the bridge, where we were headed. The other half of Newport. The less-city-more-residential section forgotten by the city, tossed aside into a separate county in a landmark transition district bill, despite the municipality of Newport still stretching far across it.</p>
<p>I had learned about the city in school. Newport was an old town--as old as an American town can be--established by British aristocracy for the bustling colonial tobacco trade. What I realized now was that its societal foundations were never uprooted and repaved. One was still either privileged or exploited without fair remuneration.</p>
<p>It truly was part of the American dream as the possibility of moving across the river always existed. One didn’t have to be adopted into nobility; they simply had to be luckier than that. On the flip side, as long as one played the game, they were always guaranteed a comfortable spot on the upper floors of an office building. So that’s what people did. They played the game like everyone else. Exploit or be exploited.</p>
<p>Where are you guys going? Jenny texted me.</p>
<p>That was a question I still had myself, so I turned to Bobby and asked.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “On Sundays, I go out and fix cars without a fee for those that otherwise can’t afford it. It’s a little deal I worked out with Mr. Martin who is kind enough to support it.”</p>
<p>“That’s actually really kind,” I said. “But why did you want me to come along?”</p>
<p>“You’re young and nimble and full of energy. I’m getting old. This can be a tough job to do when you get old.”</p>
<p>I texted Jenny back Apparently an on-the-go repair shop.</p>
<p>Is it an all-day repair shop?</p>
<p>Not sure</p>
<p>A few miles later, the truck wobbled over the curb into the driveway of a quaint home. Well-tended plants sprouted from pots lining the railing of a small patio whose wooden steps creaked under our weight. Bobby knocked against the door and a moment later, an old woman pulled it open with a man in a wheelchair at her side.</p>
<p>“Mister and Misses Polk, how are you doing this morning?”</p>
<p>“We’re doing great Bobby,” the woman said with a hoarse voice. “Who’s this fine young man?”</p>
<p>“This is Mickey. He’s helping me out today.”</p>
<p>Miss Polk stepped outside and gave me a gentle hug. “The world needs more people like you darling.”</p>
<p>It felt wrong taking the compliment because, really, I was only out here because Bobby dragged me along. And I was still getting paid anyway.</p>
<p>“Good seeing you Bobby.” Mr. Polk rolled to the door and our hands. “I don’t want to take up too much of your time.”</p>
<p>“No problem, Mr. Polk. Your truck is having the issue, right?”</p>
<p>“Can’t get the thing to start. I’d do it myself but my body just isn’t what it used to be.”</p>
<p>Bobby laughed and grabbed my shoulder. “That’s why I got Mickey here. We’ll get it fixed.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Polk closed the door behind them as she went to open the garage.</p>
<p>“How do you know them?” I asked, stepping down from the porch.</p>
<p>“Those folks are from my church.”</p>
<p>“All the way out here?”</p>
<p>“I live around here,” Bobby said. “It’s my community that I have a duty to take care of. I’ve been a part of it since I was a kid, riding my bike with my friends along this very road…” His reminiscence faded from his eyes as he swatted the air with his hand. “Your generation wouldn’t understand. Too busy on your phones.”</p>
<p>In less than an hour, the Polks’ car was fixed and we were off to the next location. During that time, Bobby explained how the Polks had to rely on their neighbors to get groceries and take them to the doctor, and that my help greatly impacted their lives. It took me until I saw the look on Mrs. Polk’s face when the truck purred once more to comprehend this fact. That I, Mickey Lee, with less than a hundred dollars to my name, had an impact on these people’s lives. I grew respect for Bobby and became grateful for him taking me out.</p>
<p>I checked my phone as we drove to the next location. Jenny had texted me ten minutes ago.</p>
<p>Another manual.</p>
<p>I guess I’ll have to teach you one day</p>
<p>The typing text bubble popped up. I curled my toes. But then it disappeared.</p>
<p>The second stop wasn’t at a house or place of work. It was under the shade of a sprawling tree at the back of the parking lot of a supermarket, where a rusted van sat idly with a man leaning against the driver-side door. As the truck squeaked to a halt, the man waved and walked over. He donned an off-white tank top, basketball shorts that desperately clung to his waist, and worn sneakers. His hair was curly and thin, his teeth yellow and missing, his arms thin and bruised.</p>
<p>Before we got out, Bobby told me, “Now, Steven doesn’t have a home. He lives in his car, so don’t make any remarks, got it?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Is he also from your church?”</p>
<p>“Him? Kind of. We run a donation drive to hand out blankets, clothes, whatever to whoever needs it. He came by one day and someone told him about me.”</p>
<p>Bobby opened the door to greet the man and I followed out from the other side.</p>
<p>“You Bobby?” Steven asked. His words were slurred and hard to make out. I figured I’d just let Bobby do the talking. </p>
<p>"Yes sir, how can I help you?" </p>
<p>“Thanks man. My a.c. ain’t working. Dunno what’s wrong with it and I don’t have no tools to fix it either. But it’s hot out here man, and I just wanna cool off.”</p>
<p>Bobby lifted the hood of the van and felt for the bar but found nothing.</p>
<p>“It broke off,” Steven said. “I’ll hold it.”</p>
<p>“No worries, let me go grab my stuff.”</p>
<p>I walked with Bobby to the back of the truck. He popped open the bed which was filled with tools and other specific parts needed for the individual stops.</p>
<p>I grabbed Bobby’s shoulder and whispered to him, “I’m pretty sure I saw drugs through the window.”</p>
<p>“Not everyone is perfect.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but, should we really be helping him? With all the money he spends on drugs, he could…”</p>
<p>Anger swelled in Bobby’s eyes and he smacked me upside the head. “You don’t think it’s help that he needs?” </p>
<p>I never knew Bobby could be mad. Like, I knew it was possible, but I could not picture it, and now I didn’t need to. The man that I had grown to respect was legitimately pissed off at me.</p>
<p>There’s an old joke that Lucas and I toss around that goes: men are only allowed to feel happy, horny, hungry, or angry, and that the three of us would never have to fear growing up because sadness was welcomed between us. Yet, in my mind, I locked two possible emotions to Bobby: happy or hungry. Him venturing from those two left me in pause. It made me feel like something had gone terribly wrong in the world for him to be this way, and that maybe finding a man stripped of hope of ever, even in his wildest dreams, crossing that bridge into a better life and welcomed by society was a world gone wrong for him.</p>
<p>We didn’t speak until the drive to the next place when he finally blurted at a red light.</p>
<p>“You know what that man does for a living? He sits near the bridge with a group of other guys every day, waiting for someone in a truck to pull over and hire some help for the day mowing lawns or cleaning pools in the hills. He tries, but he can’t get a consistent job because he doesn’t have a home or any way to stay clean from the dirt and sweat and his addiction to drugs has a death grip around his throat. But when you lose your job, then lose your apartment, then can’t find another job and are forced to go from living a normal life to begging for food, all because some rich assholes on Wall Street took advantage of the economy and drove it to the ground, what more can you expect from a man? Yes he has problems, that’s how he gets through the shame. When society chews you up and spits you out, that’s what happens. I think we owe it to him to at least try to help.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I don’t mean to yell. But I knew that man; went to school with him. He was no different than the rest of us. You have to remember, we all walk on the same path. Some of us trip along the way, some of us find short cuts, some of us just enjoy the walk. But we are all human and we are all a lot more alike than you think. You are no better than anyone else on this path. We are all going to the same destination whether we like it or not. Whether you run the path or walk it or get off early, doesn’t really matter. I know it’s hard to see that or accept it at your age. But one day you’ll be in the elderly home like everyone else your age, looking at the younger generations living a greater and more fulfilling life than you despite everything you tried, and you’ll realize then how shit a materialistic society can be.”</p>
<p>Who is a man to have a literal god weep as his son is brutally sacrificed? Would that not drive a man radical, to sacrifice his own life?</p>
<p>Who is a man to question the value of life as he rots away sitting at home unable to do anything with it, contributing literally nothing to society? Would that not drive a man suicidal?</p>
<p>Who is a man to lose their chance at accomplishing their dreams, merely slipping through their finger tips, so so close and forever gone. Would that not make a man give up on ever coming that close again?</p>
<p>That was who Bobby, Dad, and Mom were to me respectively. Yet, they were as normal as people come. As complacent with the boring life as one could be. They must not think about these things. But I do.</p>
<p>I didn’t know who I was, who I could be, who I should be, or who I would be. I merely knew that I existed because I could think and even if a god whose sole purpose was to deceive me, he could not deceive that I think. That was as far as I had come in my metaphysical journey, about as far as anyone could expect a seventeen year old to come.</p>
<p>And yet, I was being forced to tackle the other questions head on. What I wanted to do with my life, why I wanted to do it, and how I was going about it... I only had ideations and pinned my hopes solely on that. I might as well have been on a Cartesian journey to prove the existence of God, if only to save myself from being labeled a heretic and instead kiss the institution’s ass in a mist of exaggeration. How dare a kid say they don’t want to go to college and change the world?</p>
<p>Reality is disappointing when it comes to fulfilling its expectations. I was expected to do better than that.</p>
<p>Expectations are the worst thing you can put on a kid.</p>
<p>Expectations on a kid turn a game to anxiety.</p>
<p>Expectations made kids spend their youth doing nothing but studying.</p>
<p>For nothing in return.</p>
<p>But Lucas, George, and I, see, we were all determined to be at the top. We wanted to go to our dream university at the heart of Newport, Valencia University, one of the best in the world. It was more than an expectation of society. It was an expectation of ourselves. It was our key to a successful life.</p>
<p>We had a big life we wanted to live. We didn’t want to look back and regret not working hard enough. Much like Bobby said I’d be in the elderly home realizing that a rich life was no different than a poor one in the end, it meant nothing to me. Because picturing myself in that elderly home was maladaptive. All it told me was work was meaningless. That was a thought I did not find enjoyable in entertaining, as I’d be spending my life doing that very thing. So I instead dreamt of a life where I went to Valencia, graduated summa-cum-laude and became an executive in a company through connections. I did not want to regret not popping champagne or driving a Ferrari. I wanted work to be meaningful in that it allowed me to live the big life, as I had already accepted life was only meaningful in the joy I get out of every sensation and I did not want to peak in high school then spend my years watching football on the weekends and mowing a perfect yard.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this life, everything had to go perfectly, as that would be the only way I’d get into Valencia. So then, when I got my semester’s English essay back from Mrs. Spring and a swelling F circumnavigated in red ink protruded from the top of the front page, I nearly cried.</p>
<p>“Glad that’s over,” Lucas said. “Not gonna lie, I only understood about half of the Scarlet Letter. But an A’s an A.”</p>
<p>“I actually really enjoyed it,” said George. “Easy A. How about you Mickey?”</p>
<p>Twelve years of perfecting every little thing, and I fumbled everything this late in the game, when it mattered most? No, it must had been a mistake. I knew Mrs. Spring well. She was on the list of recommenders for college. And there weren’t any cross outs or anything on the page. All one had to do was turn in something and she’d give you at least a C-plus. This was either a mistake or a joke.</p>
<p>I set the thought aside until the bell rang at the end of class. Instead of following George and Lucas into the hallway, I packed slowly and waited for the class to disperse. Only then did I falter to Mrs. Spring’s desk, unknowing of how I was going to respond to this sick joke and let instinct take over.</p>
<p>“I presume this is about your grade?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am, I don’t understand…”</p>
<p>“You forgot to turn in your final draft.” She said it so carelessly and coldly that goosebumps rose on my arms. “That’s sixty percent of the project grade.”</p>
<p>No, I turned in my final draft. I didn’t turn in a rough draft. I didn’t think we needed one. What I had written was good enough for an A without much revision, and the revision I had done was done on my computer so the transition between the two was erased without a trace.</p>
<p>And now she thinks… Fuck. Oh fuck. The very thought that this one mistake would null my years of work building up a perfect resume to get into my top college. To feel like four years slipped away and I would never get this chance again. I had already fallen behind in life and I wasn’t even old enough to vote yet.</p>
<p>I did what I could to not burst into tears. How childish it might have looked to cry over a bad grade, but this was my future. This was all I had so far. This was the separation between the two lives–a star or a nobody.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Spring, tell me what I need to do to fix this and I will.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, reaching for her bag to go on lunch break. “One bad grade isn’t going to hurt you.” She was wrong. “You’re still a kid, you have a whole life yet to live.” She didn’t get it. “Let this be a life lesson for you.” She was almost single-handedly ruining my life.</p>
<p>All of this work, and I would end up going to the same local university as everyone else. All because of a single mistake. All my wasted years studying for nothing.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Spring, I have been nothing but a good student in your class. Please believe me when I tell you this is my final draft.” I was grasping for threads. I was grasping for her to change my forty percent to sixty percent. I’d end the semester with a C.</p>
<p>She stood and slung her bag over her shoulders. “Even if I did that, your grade still isn’t looking too good.” She headed for the door. I couldn’t let her go.</p>
<p>“I can work with that, Mrs. Spring. Without it, I’m on verge of failing.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “Fine, I’ll do that. See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>We were running later today. I had work. The trivialities of a spoiled childhood were coming to an end.</p>
<p>We were running together today. No negotiations. Not with Mrs. Lebedeva's surgery only a couple of days away.</p>
<p>We were running astray today. By Lucas's house. There where houses cost even more than mine, streetlights lined sidewalks.</p>
<p>New routes at different times at different paces–such differences tend to bring about new experiences.</p>
<p>The terrible thing about running as a team was that there was no room to run as an individual. I couldn't go any faster than George or Lucas. I wanted to so dearly because I had fucked up. I wanted to run until I threw up–not for a success story but to wallow in my immature misery. At least maybe then I'd feel a little better about myself.</p>
<p>Yet I was the first to slow down.</p>
<p>“Mickey, you good?” George called from ahead. Lucas stopped with him.</p>
<p>I wasn’t good. Not since I received that grade. But that’s not what slowed me down. I had rubbernecked past a driveway that of a stranger with a certain gray Ferrari with a certain license plate appended to its end that of my mother. I had never heard of her being in this part of town, especially not when Dad was wondering where she was when we got home.</p>
<p>While Lucas and George stood at the base of the driveway, I was ringing the doorbell. When the door never opened, I rang again.</p>
<p>Some persistence later, the door swung open. In its frame stood a man with messy black hair not in the styled way but in the was-styled-and-is-no-longer way. He wore an untucked button down and loose dress pants without a tie or shoes to match. Perfectly acceptable home-wear–as a matter of fact, it was probably overdone as is for home-wear–but not when my mom’s car is in the driveway at this hour.</p>
<p>He refused to say anything and simply stood there bemused, staring at this sweaty teenager banging on his door.</p>
<p>“Is my mom here?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Elizabeth Lee. Is she here?”</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>I pointed to the driveway. “That’s her car. Why aren’t you answering the question?”</p>
<p>“Go home, kid,” he said, stepping back to shut the door in my face.</p>
<p>“Mickey?” I heard Mom’s voice echo down the entryway.</p>
<p>I leaned to look past his shoulder and caught sight of her. “That’s me.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The man stepped aside and was replaced by Mom. Her shirt and hair looked to be tucked and fixed via cursory thrusts and finger combing, and her heels and watch were nowhere in sight. She was only marginally better dressed than the man who looked to have stripped all extraneous accessories the moment he stepped in the door.</p>
<p>“Hey sweetie,” she casually said as if she had regularly called me that since I was taller than her, “what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Running. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Oh you boys run around here?” She paused waiting for a response, and all I did was faintly nod my head. “Well, we have to get back to work if we want to be done. It’s been a crazy day at the office, lots of work to do.” She superficially laughed–a skill she had developed over the years to fake her way to the top–and I could tell because it’s not something she did at home.</p>
<p>“Why are you working at his house?”</p>
<p>“Like I said, a lot of stuff going on at the office. Should be better by tomorrow. I’ll see you home for dinner, okay?”</p>
<p>She had given me the answer I reluctantly came for. I shook my head and promptly resumed my jog down the driveway and up the road.</p>
<p>I did not finish my poem while running that day.</p>
<p>—-</p>
<p>When I got home, I told Dad what had happened and how Lucas and George were there to see it too. I told him the address and he drove off in a fury. Then I took a plate of food up to my room. By the time I was out of the shower, they were both home and the confrontation had begun. Words like “liar” and “cheater” and “divorce” were thrown like bricks as my mother switched from her cover story to an apology to blaming my father.</p>
<p>Part of me hoped I could wait this out in my room like a bad storm. I wasn’t scared like a child would be. A child is wholly dependent and entirely powerless, unable to get by on their own. A fraction of that was taken out of my equation–I could survive if I needed to in the worst case scenario and leave my privileged life behind. To join Steven on the other side of the river and struggle to get by. Maybe that’d be my story. Or I’d move in with Lucas in one of their five guest rooms–a slightly less exciting story.</p>
<p>That wasn’t going to happen, though. While my mom might not have liked anyone else, including my father, I knew she at least cared for me. Much like my father.</p>
<p>Whatever thoughts that were on my future career-wise remained solely on my grades as that was my ticket to college. My premontion was of my family falling apart. This was my only family. I didn’t have a brother or a sister and I hardly knew my grandparents or uncles and aunts.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like friends. If Lucas and George hated each other we could simply, although rather reluctantly, make new friends. Family was a one time thing and I had single-handedly severed the lines connecting us.</p>
<p>The more I sat one door removed from the muffled chaos, the more I regretted telling Dad. No, the more I regretted ringing the doorbell of that house in search for answers I didn’t want. I could have stayed ignorant.</p>
<p>I was too quick to judge the whole situation as I had proceeded solely on intuition about a subject I had no experience in. It is hardly what one would call intuition, more like a hunch naively mistaken for an indubitable truth.</p>
<p>What if it was a one time thing and she realized her mistakes? What if nothing was going on at all? What if I stayed quiet and they both lived happily married while she indulged in her surreptitious affair? What if I had in fact saved Dad a half-life of dejection? Only forgiveness could tell and I had not the position to give it, only to receive the consequences of our actions.</p>
<p>I still had faith in my hunch. I still believed what I did was right. It was just hard to believe as two people dearest to my heart thrust and threw and whirled words and dishes and vases and suitcases and doors until it all crescendoed into a deafening silence.</p>
<p>After a few moments, I trudged downstairs to find my dad wallowing in the livingroom.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Lee household, now forever split and stained by me. Tell me, how does one truly believe what they did was right when looking at the consequences? There is no way for me to see or know what I did right, only what I did wrong.</p>
