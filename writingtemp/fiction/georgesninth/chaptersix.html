								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Six</h1><br>
<p>Mom blaring the news and Dad sizzling eggs were as empirically evident as steam rising from my morning shower and the sun rising from the east. When Mom hadn’t come home and Dad left early, I kept my shower cold while thick clouds hung low overhead. </p>
<p>The day had yet to end as I got a meager two hours of sleep. It was growing into a painfully long one that I was only half way through. My mind grew numb in the haze to the whole ordeal and life became everso more dull. Autumn’s leaves weren’t beautiful, they were simply orange. My breakfast didn’t taste good, it was just fuel. Music wasn’t music, it was just sound. The sky was gray, the house was dead, and I was depressed.</p>
<p>I had no motivation to ready myself into a presentable state. My heart loathed all but the escape into a dream. But I had a gun to my head, pinched into my temple by a need for a future that was more bearing than hunger. I had to go to school, get good grades, compete in track at a state level, and get into Valencia, or my life was forfeit.</p>
<p>The gun to my head was all that allowed me to function under the circumstances of a normal person’s life. Surely something was missing? I pushed myself daily through more pain than most modern people bother to do in a lifetime, but I was struggling to function under their normal life conditions. Hell, I was fighting to make peanut butter and honey sandwiches.</p>
<p>A thought had lingered in my mind since George last announced his upcoming symphony: what would it be like to feel that pain? Now that thought was: how did people get through it? People who had dealt with the most terrible of things only became insouciant to their past; people who were disadvantaged from birth lived otherwise; people like George and Jenny who were actively dealing with death each had conflicting composure yet lived normal lives.</p>
<p>But Jenny… she was grief-stricken over something I had not known. What was going on in her mind? She struck my heart like an abandoned kitten on the side of the road, for she must have felt this way countless times before. Oh, how terribly I felt for her, to imagine her in the same pain as I. I did not lament at my own pain, but felt an unfeigned compassion for hers.</p>
<p>That day George adopted that abandoned kitten into his life, I was jealous. I wanted to be him, until I realized it wasn’t him that I wanted to be, but to experience his stories and live the way he had. What else would convince me the way George had that I should make a second lunch for Jenny?</p>
<p>Today, I was content with only accomplishing that, for the gun to my head and the smile on her face embroidered in my mind was all that kept me from crumbling to my knees and sleeping on the floor.</p>
<p>Even stepping into Mrs. Spring’s English class for second period made my mind falter, since it was where my subconscious mind convinced me my future fell to the ground. Yet, George, who was on the verge of losing his mother, was making the class his own.</p>
<p>“Would anyone like to volunteer their paper to be dissected?” Mrs. Spring asked.</p>
<p>George’s hand was the lone one raised into the air. So Mrs. Spring called him to the front to begin reading his paper aloud.</p>
<p>“‘Facts alone are wanted in life,’ Mr. Gragrind said, ‘Plant nothing else, and root out everything else’. To respond with purely facts would be to discredit the argument Dickens makes since it was never about the wealthy versus the poor, nor the society versus the individual, but merely the over-rationalization of an industrial society built solely on facts.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Mrs. Spring said. “So does anyone have any ideas on how we can improve this part?”</p>
<p>Then math came, and George was up on the board trying to answer questions he didn't know the answer to. He wasn't like the rest of the class in that he thought he might know the answer. He knew he didn't and in that he sought to find it out.</p>
<p>"It's fascinating," George whispered to me after butchering the solution on the board in front of thirty people. "I didn't think such a thing was possible."</p>
<p>“It’s called Gabriel’s horn,” Mr. Frederick told the class. “Infinite surface area but finite volume. The proof will be on your final, so make sure to study it.” </p>
<p>Mr. Frederick turned to the board and began writing the next problem. I collapsed into my arms on the desk and buried my face from the light. Even one second outside of this class was blissful.</p>
<p>“You okay?” George quietly asked me. It was the second time in twenty-four hours. It was almost audacious for him to ask me that.</p>
<p>“How do you get through the day? Each day. With everything going on. I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>He peered at me, perplexed and questioning. “Will you tell me what’s going on?”</p>
<p>I never intended to burden him with my problems when he was so close to dealing with his own, but it was too late for that. “Later today, I promise.”</p>
<p>George sighed. “Well, I always have something to look forward to. Coffee in the morning. Lunch with you guys. Our run after school. Joey at home. If one thing goes wrong, I have nine more. And soon I’ll see Mom back home, I’ll submit college applications, and I’ll compete at that state tournament. As much as there are small things there are big things.”</p>
<p>It sounded so simple, yet I had things to look forward to today and still couldn’t do it. It felt like they were all going wrong. The only things I had to look forward to was my charade with Jenny and sleep. I didn’t even want to run.</p>
<p>My next period was western civilization. The whole class was a blur. We talked about the Romans, then I dozed off. The stoics, I dozed off. The Christains, I dozed off. The third time, Mr. Champi gave me a final warning, so I had to do what I could to stay awake the last twenty minutes. Live like George. Do the stupid shit he did and I’d make it.</p>
<p>Mr. Champi pointed at a timeline of Rome on the projector. “Now, if the Roman government did not officially start persecuting Christians until Emperor Nero, why do you think the Romans painfully crucified Jesus instead of using the normal means of execution?”</p>
<p>I raised my hand. “Because they wanted to make an example.”</p>
<p>"Not quite," he said, "anyone else?” </p>
<p>Hugo, the person that sat next to me, raised his hand. “He was a threat to the church, not the government, so the church chose the means of execution.”</p>
<p>“Closer, but still no. Anyone else? Well, he was crucified because he was born in a Roman province and never became a Roman citizen. Quick beheadings were only for Roman citizens. The crucifixion ended up making Jesus’s image all the more symbolic in modern day. It is something you will see in history time and time again, that the impact of the greatest events aren’t realized until years, decades, or centuries later. Columbus’s voyage, Treaty of Versailles, Rosetta Stone… made by common individuals.”</p>
<p>Ironic. Even the proclaimed son of God had an exaggerated story on his resume. But at least it was still a story, and that I did not have.</p>
<p>I did not answer a single question right that entire class, but it kept me awake. It also made everyone else wonder what was wrong with me. The idea of doing something different than the personality assigned to you from the first week was alien to them all. Change is weird, and always has been weird as Mr. Champi taught. Change interrupts their status quo of complacency, that once one falls into their slot in the world, they must never move from it, or they risk changing the projected course of their world.</p>
<p>The bell rang and the room filled with screeching chairs and chatter as half of the class stalled to get to the next period while the other half swarmed to lunch. “Everyone have a safe afternoon,” Mr Champi yelled. “See you all tomorrow.”</p>
<p>I pushed my way through the door and down the long, bustling hallways of bodies out to the courtyard for lunch. I was excited to breathe unbreathed air and each breath brought a butterfly flapping into my lungs. Inside me stirred a strange sensational blend of a delirious drowsiness and anxious boyhood, a feeling I had not felt before. I wanted to perpetuate it all as much as I wanted to release it all and get the day’s goal over with.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, even though Jenny and I were in different grades, we shared overlapping lunch times. I could see her from the doors, in the middle where a table for twelve sat sixteen with four different conversations going on at once. I imagined enough drama interchanged the table to satisfy a newspress. She was squished in the middle with, of course, no lunch in front of her. Her side was turned to me and she was engulfed in conversation, so when I walked behind and leaned over her shoulder to set the second brown bag down, she spun in shock, whiffing the looseness of my shirt with the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>“Courtesy of the Lee household,” I said, and bowed, because my mind was still half asleep.</p>
<p>The two girls she was talking to across the table giggled. Jenny’s face shot a bright pink. “What’s this for?”</p>
<p>“For lunch, you goofball.”</p>
<p>One of her friends, trying not to die of laughter, asked, “Is the other bag for me?”</p>
<p>“I put extra snacks in hers if she wants to share.” </p>
<p>That set them off enough to attract the attention of everyone else at the table. I might as well have been George cuddling a kitten, except the things he did were natural and mine gawky. He didn’t try to be himself, he just was. </p>
<p>I didn’t pay further attention to them and shot Jenny a peace sign–because my mind was still half asleep–as I headed over to my table with George and Lucas on the outskirts. </p>
<p>Jenny stood and stomped after me. “Why are you acting like an idiot?”</p>
<p>I looked over my shoulder. Her face was a fury and the natural part of me wanted to poke her some more so she would go back and eat her stupid lunch and stop making a scene. “A cute idiot, I don’t reject it.”</p>
<p>“The audacity you emit is astounding.” She shook her head and turned away.</p>
<p>“Just trying to do something nice,” I mumbled, subconsciously doing so just loud enough that she could hear. I shook the thought and continued toward my table, hoping she wouldn’t react. Why I was confiding my pain in her was something that eluded me</p>
<p>Jenny grabbed my shoulder with a fistful of cloth and forced me to face her. She pulled at my shirt and clenched her teeth ready to retaliate. Her seething stare into my eyes felt penetrating and consuming. Then she paused. Her furrowed brows relaxed and raised, her grip loosened on my shirt, her bottom lip fell open just a tiny bit, and then she asked with all the sincerity in the world, “Are you okay, manual?”</p>
<p>She struck me out of my haze for a split-second, long enough for me to remember I was sad. I had been too tired to even remember. But I remembered now. All the bad feelings flowed back into me while I was staring into Jenny’s hazel eyes as hers stared back into mine. My heart, in its vulnerable, fluttered state, clung onto her. I wanted to tell her “I had a really bad day yesterday” and melt in her grip. I wanted to tell her “things seem to be falling apart” and hug her and cry.</p>
<p>Would I be a fool to try?</p>
<p>Would the attempt be a solidification of my failure? Or would not trying reaffirm my failure to not live as I determined to do?</p>
<p>Only in this delirious state would I have the courage, here, now, in front of everyone, and the anxious contemplation dissolved into a desire above my apprehension.</p>
<p>Then a voice among the giggles shouted from the table, “Did you bring lunch for her boyfriend too?”</p>
<p>And my apprehension returned insufferable, flattening my heart and folding my lungs. Everyone’s gaze </p>
<p>Jenny didn’t flinch at the backhanded comment, because in her mind, I was only doing this as a friend.</p>
<p>I should have been. She was George’s sister for Christ’s sake. And over a year younger. And now a coworker. I should have been treating her the same way I treated all my other friends.</p>
<p>“I haven’t slept well,” I told her. “But I’m fine, I promise.” A promise that made me a liar. To people I cared about, I never lied. A promise was a promise. But it was my way of reminding myself who she was. Just an associate. A coworker. A best friend’s younger sister. She gave me a brief, friendly hug that I ceased longing and went back to her table, and I went to mine in hopes George and Lucas didn’t catch a thing.</p>
<p>But the day just kept getting worse.</p>
<p>Lucas sat with folded arms, holding back a smirk. “I’m going to pretend I didn’t see that.”</p>
<p>“Fuck off,” I said, collapsing into my seat. I set my brown bag down without opening it.</p>
<p>“Lighten up,” George said, setting down his sandwich and rubbing his napkin. “You beat me the other day. I told you I’d be fine with it.”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “That was a joke.”</p>
<p>“Even if it was, I trust you more than anyone else to make her happy again.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that. We’re just friends.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see, is that what’s been going on?”</p>
<p>“No!... It's not that either.” But it was now. The embarrassment lingered. I was both disappointed with reality and with myself.</p>
<p>“Okay, sorry.” George sighed and picked his sandwich back up. “You still look like shit though. I've never seen bags under someone’s eyes hang so low and be so dark.”</p>
<p>“Are they really that bad?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Lucas said in between mouthfuls. “You going to bed when school ends?”</p>
<p>“Still have work." Which normally wasn't unfortunate. It would get me through the hours, but I didn't want to do anything.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Instead of going to the world’s worst cafe after school, Jenny and I were headed to the shop for a handful of hours before the sunset and closing time came. Lucas and George were off doing their own thing while Jenny and I did a job that became increasingly repetitive yet more comforting by the day. It wasn’t repetitive in the sweat-shop kind of way. Yet it wasn’t stressful day-by-day. There were no deadlines or micromanaging bosses. No politics or robots would ruin or take over our jobs. It was a groove. Like a run without the pain, which sounds nice. But if working on cars was walking through a garden, then running was fighting a war, and neither was particularly special without the other to contrast.</p>
<p>The seamless groove ended up placing me in a different world. I was in a classroom at Valencia. It was only me that I recognized in the room. Ten-twenty had struck, and the teacher took attendance and dismissed class. I couldn’t remember how I got there or what special thing had happened to land me in the school of my dreams despite the grades I received in English, but I was there, no doubt. In the hallways I made newfound friends. We went to the beach and surfed despite me only vaguely knowing how to swim. I hooked up with a beautiful girl and we danced till the bars closed. In the morning I went to track practice for the university’s team preparing to compete at nationals. At night I dined at a fine restaurant with entrepreneurs and experts. The days continued on and on, and not once did the novelty wear off. My dreams were coming true before my eyes, but the lingering gap in time between senior year and college frightened me in my reluctance to accept such great stories were happening to me.</p>
<p>I shot awake. A hand ruffled my hair. The light stung my eyes. I was sitting on the floor of the shop, hardly aware of where I was.</p>
<p>"Morning manual."</p>
<p>I fell back against the wall. Her voice would lull me back to sleep if I wasn’t careful. “Caught in the act."</p>
<p>"Caught is an overstatement. Half of the city saw you sleeping out here as they passed by. You've been out for an hour."</p>
<p>In only an hour, my mind had deceived itself that it had lived another life just as real as the one before it as though I could be pulled out of this one too at any moment. Maybe I was tired, maybe I was insane, but part of me felt content with leaving this life to return to the other one. To leave George and Lucas and Jenny and my parents and everyone else behind, because living the life of stories was that good. After all, I tend to have bad cases of sleeping in just to return to those dreams, though with the expectation of returning back to this one. I often wondered if it was the nightly dreams that drove my lust for living a life worthy of those dreams, for I spend a third of my life living entire lifetimes, where a mere minute in this life was an hour in that one. If it wasn’t for my mind dumping the dreams upon wake, my life would be more dream than real. How daunting is that? That I knew the me of my dreams better than I knew myself. That every night was a story unfolding, and every morning was the reminder that my real life–real only in the sense that it is perpetual–was blander than the blandest of dreams. What insane man drinks from a river by day and the fountain of youth by night?</p>
<p>I rolled my head towards the empty spot where the car I was working on had been. I might as well have skipped work. “Fuck, my dad is going to be pissed.”</p>
<p>Jenny knelt down and plucked a white string off my black shirt. “If he was pissed he would have woken you up, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Maybe so.” Maybe disappointment was the right word.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I took care of everything on my own. But it's closing time, which means it's time for you to get up."</p>
<p>No sight was ever more humbling than seeing Jenny stand back up and stretch her hand toward me.</p>
<p>Why were these people, the people who would laugh in the face at my troubles for the sheer amount of theirs, content and helping me? Me who had hardly tasted the cruel side of the world, and wallowed like a child. Me who was utterly nobody and would stay nobody because no great or equally terrible thing would ever happen. Me whose mental anguish was greater than that of a starving third-world child because for the first time in my life I experienced denial and so much had been going well for me that I never dealt with it. I always thought myself to be a disciplined man–someone who could run to the world's end no matter the agony, or could spend the entire night studying without a break or pause, or remain patient under the most trying of times–but that was clearly not the case. Clearly, I was failing to live the life before me.</p>
<p>“Well, come on,” she said.</p>
<p>I grabbed her hand and lugged myself up. “Are you in a rush?”</p>
<p>“George told you that my dad flew out to be with my mom a couple of days ago, right?”</p>
<p>“Wait, you two are home alone?”</p>
<p>“Oh, he didn’t tell you?” </p>
<p>I shook my head. It was strange he hadn’t, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized he didn’t want to put up with Lucas and I rushing to his side. Sick and tired of people taking his own news worse than him.</p>
<p>“Well, anyway, George and I have some errands to run in their stead, so I want to get that over with before my show comes on.”</p>
<p>I checked my phone. Sure enough, a text from George to Lucas and I was sent an hour ago. Sorry guys, we’ll be running later, probably after sun down. I figured we could just run by Lucas’s house again in the street lights.</p>
<p>I’d rather not I texted back. I didn’t want to catch the same sight as last time. Can we just run our usual route? I put my phone away and said to Jenny, “If you need my help, let me know.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine, just make sure George doesn’t do anything stupid later.” The doors to the garage began to lower. Jenny grabbed her bag off the ground and walked out to the other side of them. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Mickey.”</p>
<p>“You too, Jenny.”</p>
<p>We split like long-time co-workers. Complacent and casual. Two things I hated; Two things I involuntarily yielded.</p>
<p>The doors slowly cut off my sight of her and I wondered if I’d see her again before the surgery, and if she’d still be the same Jenny I knew.</p>
<p>We ran our usual route, down and about to my house under the darkening sky. The run itself was only usual in the sense of direction. No two runs are ever the same, for while the roads stayed still, the story in my head changed each time, and I was a subtly different man than the one I was before. Today I was in a haze. No vigilante story played in my head. I only slipped into a more pathetic version of myself compared to the days before.</p>
<p>But George… if any man had changed that day, it was him. I could see the look in his eyes–straight under his furrowed brows–and the way he tied his shoes–not in the method but in his jerking motions–that meant he was going to run. It was the runner’s high, the masculine necessity, and the adrenaline from the pent up anger building in his heart over the past week that he hid beneath his breast.</p>
<p>“Today is the day,” George said to us, “that I beat my personal record.” He pulled his ankles to his glutes one by one. “And after that I will fix the one regret I have in life before it becomes unfixable. And after that, well, we’ll see.”</p>
<p>He raised his watch and beeped its buttons, ready to start the timer.</p>
<p>“What’s your regret?” I asked.</p>
<p>“If I told you, that would ruin the surprise. I’m saving that for after the run.” He set his timer and began down the sidewalk.</p>
<p>Lucas and I followed behind, but we knew we would be unable to keep up with George’s pace. Instead, we just watched him increase the distance between us minute by minute.</p>
<p>Nothing ever feels real</p>
<p>When real is undefined</p>
<p>My dreams are yearnings</p>
<p>And my life lifeless</p>
<p>Only a thin, vast line</p>
<p>Holds the mind in place</p>
<p>But when the mind is hazed</p>
<p>The line draws evermore thin</p>
<p>The essence of dreams leak</p>
<p>And slip into reality…</p>
<p>A car swerved by us, running across the bumps on the shoulder, where rain water would collect and run along against the raised edge of the sidewalk. I could feel the breeze by my arm. It sent goosebumps up my skin. Through the window of the Cadillac, I could see the man in a suit on his phone in a rush to get home from work. Lucas cursed under his breath, and the car continued speeding down the round and swerving around the corner onto the bridge over the dam–the two mile marker from my house. The run was nearing its end and George was out of sight.</p>
<p>A minute later, we heard screeching tires, crunching plastic, and the distancing of an howling engine. We both sighed in annoyment. On the day of George’s grand run, we would have to stop for this nonsense. My only hope was that George was far enough ahead that turning back for the accident was too trivial to bother.</p>
<p>We turned the corner towards the bridge, expecting to see a wrecked car in the other one’s leave, only we saw nothing. Just the continual passing of traffic, until one car turned on its caution lights and pulled to the side. A lady got out of the car and ran to the railing, peeking down the side of the dam where water was held back for the night. Lucas and I shot each other a look, confused at what she was looking at, as it wasn’t like we heard a car fall into the water.</p>
<p>A few uneasy moments passed before we finally reached her.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Lucas asked, slowing down as we approached her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she frantically sputtered. “I thought I saw something go over.”</p>
<p>“Like a car?”</p>
<p>“No, like a deer. I don’t know, I was down the road.”</p>
<p>We looked over the edge. It was dark, but there was still enough light to faintly see the top of the water. Still as can be. Not a ripple.</p>
<p>“Or like a runner?” Lucas questioned.</p>
<p>“Was someone running ahead of you two?”</p>
<p>Lucas whispered only slightly louder than the wind, “George.” Then he screamed, “George!” No response came. Hardly a hesitation later, he climbed the railing and jumped out into the dark.</p>
<p>I froze. Fear gripped my heart. Doubt clouded my mind. It couldn’t be possible. If it was possible, it couldn’t be real. If it was real… George was fifty feet below motionless under the water and there was no chance to question it.</p>
<p>I looked over the edge one last time, unable to jump, then ran to the edge of the bridge and scrambled down the hill side. It was a physical impossibility that George had fallen over that railing. Lucas resurfaced to breathe, splashing around, then dove back under. There was no other struggle in the water when there would have been if George was in it. I jumped in the water regardless and swam out as best I could.</p>
<p>We swam about in the water for minutes with nothing to show. I was nearing a relieving conclusion that If George had fallen, one of us would have found him, and we were overreacting to the woman’s delusion. But Lucas only panicked more and more, certain the possibility came true, so I continued with him, inattentively searching while I waited for him to swim back to shore and continue our run so we could meet George at my house and celebrate.</p>
<p>My hand brushed past something and my heart sank. I felt for it again. Then all doubt was gone. All this time, George had been under the water, and I had found him. I reached around his arms and pulled him onto me, and swam backwards with a ferocity back to shore. “I… I got him!”</p>
<p>When I reached shore, Lucas was there and grabbed George from my arms and drug him onto the dirt, then immediately started pumping George’s chest.</p>
<p>All I could do was sit back in disbelief that such a thing couldn’t have truly happened. The haze helped me convince myself this was all a dream that I would be pulled from. That this sweat was the sweat of my sleep, this fogginess in my brain was just an oddly lucid dream, and no story like this would ever realistically happen to me. Yet never once did I fear waking as I normally would.</p>
<p>After Lucas have a round of breaths to George, he said, “Mickey, take over, I’m tired.”</p>
<p>So I started pushing into George’s chest and giving him rounds of breaths.</p>
<p>I still need you George. I need you to show me. How did you do it? What was your regret? How are you who you are?</p>
<p>I didn’t know if George was going to die here. If so, he’d die with his parents hundreds of miles away without ever knowing if his mother would survive. With only dreams of a future that would never come, that he worked so hard for and would amount to as nothing as it would amount to in the end. But it wasn’t George. George was full of life and energy. Below my pumping arms was just an empty body, staring lifelessly at the sky as my sweat, water, and tears mixed into its own.</p>
<p>This can’t be your last story.</p>
<p>Sirens rang into the vicinity overhead. Down the hillside came paramedics, and Lucas and I were pushed aside. Then cops then the ambulance, and George was carried up the hill, into the ambulance, and off into the distance.</p>
<p>I hugged Lucas. He hugged me back. I wept.</p>
<p>I had begged and pleaded for a life that brought me deeper than my feet could wander. Now, I couldn't breathe. I couldn’t justify standing on my feet.</p>
<p>Eventually, the police escorted Lucas and I back to the top, where now the bridge was closed off and people swarmed the yellow tape. </p>
<p>Life had peaked down at the shoreline, and it only garnered my hatred for everyone around me on the road above–all the cadillacs and grand wagoneers parked behind the tape, people who could've been there for George's family, but were too distracted and careless to do anything, and instead acted as though their goal was to kill off the Lebedev's one by one.</p>
<p>Where were these people when Lucas and I were looking for George? Were they up here fighting to be the first to call 911? Where were these people when George's family needed help? Were they too busy counting the pennies saved up that they’d never spend anyway? And why are they here in the aftermath, if they didn’t care?</p>
