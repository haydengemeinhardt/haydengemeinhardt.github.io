<p>On Saturday, Bobby drove me around once more, fixing cars as we had always done. I thought of Diogenes and how ironic it was for the school to chant his name, as mad of a man he might have been. And as empirical as he might have been, no one in Newport would ever follow his name, no matter how much alike they were to him as deep into poverty as they were. I could see it in the homes Bobby brought me to. People still clung onto what materialistically valuable items they could—a family heirloom, an expensive watch, or, in this case, a car that looked to be worth more than the house.</p>
<p>I pulled the floor jack out of the back of the truck as Bobby walked with the man back to his door. I held my tongue until he returned, knowing that Bobby had an answer. He seems to have an answer for everything. Knowing exactly his place and why he does what he does. I knew that any counter I could raise would be met with an answer, since my counters would be raised from predictable intuition and his answers from decades of reminisce over the same questions and more. </p>
<p>The front door shut, and Bobby returned to me dutifully raising the car. Not a second after he grabbed the jack stands from the truck did I question him, “Why do we help a man maintain that which he cannot afford?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” he asked, kneeling to put a jack stand in place. “We’ve been doing this for weeks.”</p>
<p>“I mean, why are we fixing this car? When it is clear that he can sell it for a more reliable one than toil with it and ask for our help when there are other people who don’t have that same luxury?”</p>
<p>“Do you think it is right to freely fix cars when people don’t even have homes for the winter?” Bobby grunted as he raised himself off the ground. I imagined half of it was from old age in the joints, and old age in hearing such a bugging question. “Go build homes, Mickey, if that’s what you so please.”</p>
<p>“There is a line, as arbitrary as it may be, and this is past it.”</p>
<p>“That line Hugo told you about?”</p>
<p>I nodded, rolling the jack to the other side.</p>
<p>He flicked his hand. “You made that line yourself.”</p>
<p>“But I believe it exists somewhere. At least amidst a gray area, which giving money to a wealthy man is well beyond.”</p>
<p>“We are here to fix cars, and if it is simply to save a man money, so be it. But not all of our deeds are about money, despite what you may think. Most of the time, money is just a convenient middleman, or a strange formality in our case, that we remove out of courtesy. Don’t confuse that for the deed itself.”</p>
<p>I disguised my pause as positioning the jack. “If not for money, why are we here?”</p>
<p>“This man is a friend. His wife bought the car for him when they found out there was a chance he would only live a few more months. In the end, he survived, but she has since passed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“So, to answer your question,” Bobby grunted as he placed the jack stand, “we are here because he hardly has the mental state to take care of himself, let alone everything around him.” He stood and took a deep breath, dusting his hands against each other. “I don’t think it was a waste of money then, even if they were poor, as you seem to think. And I don’t think he should get rid of it because it is burdensome to maintain. Sometimes our mind holds onto unreasonable things, but that doesn’t mean we should let them go for being unreasonable. Emotion is as much part to us as our rationale, and good thing too.”</p>
<p>Bobby and I each grabbed our respective wrenches from the back of the truck to take the wheels off. I ceased to continue questioning him as I collected my thoughts, but he continued regardless:</p>
<p>“Why does someone need a sob story for you to help them? Why can’t you just be gracious in your everyday life, indiscriminate and kindhearted?”</p>
<p>“I only have so much time to spend doing so, so I avoid helping those who don’t need it as much as others. In this case, those who can afford to just pay to have their brakes bled in the shop when there is an infinite line of cars of those in actual poverty. It just doesn’t make sense to gift those who already have the gift of wealth.”</p>
<p>“You think it is a gift?”</p>
<p>“What else would you consider never having financial struggles again to be?”</p>
<p>Bobby shook his head and rolled the tire into the grass. “Your mind has been fixated on this ever since George passed. I get it. I really do.” He took my wrench as I lugged my tire off and tossed the wrenches into the truck, but he returned with nothing, so that we were just two guys aimlessly standing in front of a car without front wheels.</p>
<p>“How would you define what a gift is?”</p>
<p>“To receive a valuable thing without recompense.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” he said, leaning against the truck. “You believe that those who carry money can fix innumerable problems in the world while never having to face those problems themselves. I can’t disagree with that. No one can. But then we look around and see the problems persist and those people continue to amass their hoard of wealth and we wonder if those people are indeed evil to not bat an eye at human suffering. Tell me, can a man be evil if he cannot see the suffering unfold?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I asked, eager to listen. After nights of restless, uneasy contemplation, I grew grateful to be able to simply ask and let it be answered with all the wisdom of the ages with no effort on my part but to listen.</p>
<p>“Let me put it this way: there are two means of becoming rich. The first pertains to you. It is to be born into it. If one is born into it, they can never understand what poverty is like, so they will not understand the pain a person goes through. Much like how a non-alcoholic will never understand the task of becoming sober, or a kid with loving parents never understand what it means to be an orphan.”</p>
<p>“But I can see the pain of—”</p>
<p>“Mickey, I don’t mean to be rash, but from the first day I took you out, I knew you hadn’t the faintest idea of what it truly meant to not have money.”</p>
<p>“I still sympathize with them.”</p>
<p>“Like a noble to a peasant. It is pity that you have, and no one wants your pity, I can tell you that.”</p>
<p>I looked to the ground and nodded.</p>
<p>“I don’t consider you to be evil, Mickey, just naïve, and somewhat blind, though less so than you were when I first met you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I can appreciate that.”</p>
<p>“And so you should,” said Bobby. “Now, for someone who holds empathy as high of a value as you do, don’t you think it wouldn’t be a gift being born into a rich family such that you might remain blind to that value? Meaning, you are granted never having to struggle financially, but don’t you pay with the loss of that moral value?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I would agree from my own point of view. I wouldn’t want to be blind to the wrongs of murder or any other moral value of mine, no matter how much peace it might bring me.”</p>
<p>“And if you were to live a prosperous life or inherit a huge sum because of your family, do you think it would be paradoxical to hold the virtue of empathy above luxury yet remain in luxury? And thus is no more a gift than if you weren’t born into wealth at all?”</p>
<p>Even though I knew my answer, I hesitated. It was something I had contemplated, but when asked to say it aloud to someone other than myself, the pretentiousness of it—the reticence of voicing any unspoken conviction—lobbed its way into my throat. “Yes. I would like to think that I would live at a reasonable comfort such that I don’t put others beneath me.”</p>
<p>“I respect the thought,” said Bobby. “Where you will actually draw that line remains to be seen. But for the purpose of the argument, we will say it remains where you placed it. So, then you would agree that being born into wealth is neither inherently evil nor a gift?”</p>
<p>I paused, making sure I understood that which was most pertinent to me. “I guess so.”</p>
<p>“The other means of obtaining wealth is to mindlessly pursue it. One does not become rich simply by working as hard as everyone else. No, you need to make it the most important thing in your life. To ascend it nearly to the top of your hierarchy of values. It is a requisite that money becomes—at a relatively low point—more important than your sympathy, otherwise you would invest a significant amount of your newfound fortune into charities than in companies. I would also consider it to be a sickness because that at the top drives you like a god would. Your goal in life becomes to build your hoard of gold as tall as possible, even if it means putting others beneath you, since that is the only way you can outcompete the others who do the same. One only needs to look to the plantations of past Newport to know that much.”</p>
<p>“You don’t consider a plantation to be evil?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it is evil for sure, but be careful not to miss my point. Regardless, we at least agree that it is not a gift to be evil?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p>“Then we can ignore the absurdities,” Bobby declared, “for those are not gifts either. Let’s then only consider people who are wealthy but not cruel to others. Most of these people work long days, so much that their life becomes consumed by work and what little is left is spent resting their mind so they can continue the next day. Naturally, these people would not spend time and effort contemplating hurt in the world when they are already pushed to their own limits, and thus become blind to it. Do you think that is a fair statement?”</p>
<p>“Yes, if that’s how money becomes most important above all.”</p>
<p>“Do you consider these people evil?”</p>
<p>“No, since we have established that being blind is not evil.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Bobby said, even pointing a finger at me. “And do you consider working away your entire life away in a job to be a gift?”</p>
<p>“No,” I replied, “very much the opposite if you do not like the job. But what if you enjoy your job?”</p>
<p>“Then you will be content with working away so that you will never face financial struggles, and thus become blind once more, which we know is not evil.”</p>
<p>“But is that not a gift?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I would question if working all day, whether you enjoy it or not, would be equivalent to simply living the life of a beast of burden. That I don’t consider a gift. But even if it is not equivalent, I think that, yes, you could consider the love to work to be a gift, but it does not mean the consequent wealth itself is a gift. Much like your passion to run could be a gift, but the body you attain from that is one you earned. You spent time and pain for it.”</p>
<p>“Where are you going with this, Bobby? You are confusing me.”</p>
<p>“My point is that that which is attained is defined almost entirely by how it was attained. There are a million different paths we can work out that lead to wealth—some may be evil or a gift, others may be absurd, noble, rational, deranged, virtuous, or even transcendental. But that is what makes stories, journeys, and adventures so alluring to you, Mickey, because they define your place in the world. And if it is not defined, then it is meaningless.”</p>
<p>For weeks, I understood why I wanted stories so badly. Or I thought I did. I never could formulate it into words, and Bobby had done it for me. It felt like having the words not realized by me belittled them, and yet they explained my actions so perfectly that it’s as if the actions themselves were belittled. Once the mystique is explained away, thoughts surrounding it become null, because there is no longer any contemplation to be done over it. It just is. Or, so it would be if I thought it was the end, as if perpetually asking “why?” had some conclusion.</p>
<p> “I don’t think you believe these things yourself.”</p>
<p>“Not to the extent that you currently do,” Bobby replied. “You tout charity above all else, but I have bills to pay, a family to feed, and a retirement to look forward to. Your crises are exhausting and better dealt with when you are young—eager and full of energy. I’m well past that stage, and sometimes your pestering makes me wonder why I bother repeating it.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you believe? Do you think it is an evil path to take to abandon virtue for comfort?”</p>
<p>“Do you think it is evil to be a Nazi soldier while your neighbors are taken away, when you know that if you refused, your parents, brothers, sisters, wife, and children would be taken away too?”</p>
<p>“That is an absurd comparison.”</p>
<p>“And even in such an absurdity, I do not know what evil is, nor what path I would take were I to know the answer. Yet, that is where your morals truly show.”</p>
<p>To think that even someone as acute as Bobby wouldn’t know himself was unnerving. What that made everyone else was terrifying.</p>
<p>“I don’t blame people who strive for comfortable lives. We all do to some extent. But if you consider being blind to the abyss—at least until you are forced to confront it—worthy of ridding yourself of a car payment, mortgage, healthcare, and the rest and living a life of luxury, then that is the choice you make. But, as we have concluded, it is not a gift to take that path, nor to not take it, so much as it is to choose any other path. I do not think that our society is at a point yet to call any of it fundamental truth. One day we might adopt it as we have equality or democracy, but until then, we have no right to declare one way or another. We have only the right to choose to look down upon those who walk a different path, or to be understanding and coincide with each other in this cacophony of a world.”</p>
<p>After that, Bobby went to get the wrenches so we could get back to work. He always liked to conclude his rants on notes of compassion, so I knew that the conversation was at risk of rearing its end whenever they came about. If there was any fundamental truth, it was that that he would hold. I tried not to let it bias my journey, but such a simple, warm meaning allured me.</p>
