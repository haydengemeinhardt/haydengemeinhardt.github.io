Need to learn the course of world history in a day? Here you go.
</p>
<p>
I’m an avid history lover. As a matter of fact, I nearly went to college to get a degree in history, so you can image why I grabbed this book off the clearance shelf when I saw it.
</p>
<p>
Because the book covers literally all of human history in 180 short pages, it only talks about the surface of each event, which meant I learned less than I expected to. You’d get the same information for each topic in an Instagram post (the author could definitely make an Instagram page out of this). That being said, it is great for those who do not know much about history.
</p>
<p>
I only have a couple of complaints with the book.
</p>
<li>It focuses too much on the Western world, though it does better than a lot of history books</li>
<li>Lots and lots of death. Kinda depressing. But I get it, that’s the unfortunate reality of human history.</li>
<li>Strange ending. It dedicates multiple pages to WW2 (abnormally) and doesn’t cover post WW2. I was honestly expecting at least up to 9/11.</li>
<p>
I’ll give it a 3/6. Again, great for those who do not know much about history, but left me underwhelmed.
