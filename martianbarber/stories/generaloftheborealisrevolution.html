								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">General of the Borealis Revolution</h1><br>
								

<p><i>Purpose: This argument is an unaltered debate I had with myself over a cup of coffee one night, organized into this short story between the barber and a retired general, hero of the second American Civil War, or the Borealis Revolution as coined by the members of the northern colony-turned-nation (more on this lore in another story). I decided to leave it unedited to contrast that with a real debate. You can probably notice many turning points where my mind had changed from one side to the other as I either struggled to come up with a counterpoint or had a realization to an opposing viewpoint. These ideas very likely could be organized in more coherent writing, although I believe it would be counterproductive to the entire point of the writing. I also wrote this right after finishing Hard Times by Charles Dickens, so the writing style is slightly inspired by his, though nowhere near as masterful.</i></p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>	Insta-cut shops were the worst thing to happen to the hair-cutting business since… well, since forever. For the price of a cup of coffee and at the speed of making it, one could get weekly cuts to keep their hair in tip-top shape. It was a weekly routine for most. And these dreadful shops infest nearly every other corner of the city, ruining the art of hair-styling.</p><p>On the contrary, the best thing to happen to barbers like me was the dying tradition of long hair, essentially doubling my customer base. As the story goes, long hair and pressurized suits did not mix well, so men and women alike adopted for shorter hair. Although it isn’t so much an issue anymore, the trend stayed, and it is, in part, why I’m able to do what I do, as opposed to the nearly extinct hair salons.</p><p>The woman seated in the chair, however, was not one to cut their hair short for some fashion trend. No, she was a retired general of the Borealis Army--a veteran of its fight for independence.</p><p>“I’m never not honored to cut your hair,” I exclaim, rather embarrassingly.</p><p>	“I was no more than a cog in the machine of war,” her coarse voice spits, remanence of her growing old, “fighting against the next great empire that had spread its borders too thin and corruption too broad.”</p><p>	“But it’s that latter sentiment that we all rejoiced for!” I exclaim, speaking to my time on Earth when I was a boy of merely a high school age. </p>

<p>The night the news broke was one of those nights you know you’d remember forever. It was dark, the night sky a canvas black with the stars blotched out by the lake of yellow lights sprinkled throughout the city below, streaks of red darting through. Me and a handful of friends gathered on the hillside to watch the launching of a rocket from the nearby station, with a bad habit of smoking to accompany us. The neighboring airport of incoming and outgoing travelers to the station had landed all flights for the night, and far off in the distance, the top of the rocket peaked over the crest of a hill.</p><p>The three of us dangled our legs over the ledge with cigarettes in our hand, dreaming of boarding a rocket one day and leaving the wretched planet as if mankind would enlighten upon the sight of its tiny place in the universe. It was the optimism of youth, the bliss of ignorance, the wishful thinking of a child who truly believed in a world they could climb like their father’s stepladder when he’d invite them to a view from the roof on a brisk autumn afternoon.</p><p>	The engines of the rocket blazed to life, lighting the night sky. We began our countdown, memorizing the timing of the launch. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two… then the sky went dark. The engines shut off. I don’t think any of us dropped our stare, though I couldn’t say, as mine was too affixed on the crest. But what I can say is no one said a word. We were all fearing an imminent explosion. What else could it be? I had never heard of anything like it.</p><p>	“It’s only natural,” she says, breaking my thought. “It’s only natural we root for the underdogs, as the majority of us have been doing it since the dawn of man.”</p><p>	“Nonsense! We were against the bureaucratic institution, against the idea that the surging loss of jobs couldn’t get aid because the military industrial complex was lining their pockets.”</p><p>	“And what does the complex profit most off of?” she shoots as though she has done so a million times, tired of hearing it repeatedly yet with enough opinion to address it eagerly. “It’s catch twenty-two.”</p><p>	It wasn’t just the military complex people hated, as it wasn’t the Stamp Act that brought upon the American Revolution, but it nonetheless was a stapled figure beaten blue. An ideology quickly divided among not so easy lines yet ever thin. If one preached against the idea of a revolution--no matter how true their intents were to save the lives of those pawned in the game, nor matter how rational an argument created to present the counterintuitive nature of the war--they were deemed proponents of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman by the opposing side. And if one preached against the idea of diplomacy, to bring about prompt and ambitious change to a failing system, they were deemed premature war criminals by the other opposing side. And God help anyone who walked the line in the middle.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 3</h3><p>	“You know, you never told me why you fought,” I point out, finally pulling the topic to hand. “Was it for patriotism, ideology?”</p><p>	“There’s no patriotism in battle, nor ideology,” she retorts, waving the left of her exposed hands from behind the black cape. “After a few days that goes away, and no sooner nor later any other reason you may have joined. You fight for your brothers, your honor, and your reputation. From the Confederate and Union soldiers of the first civil war to Doughboys and Nazis and Redcoats and Legionaries alike. There’s no difference. That’s what makes it all so twisted.”</p><p>“But I?” she continues, “I had grown to a position where I was no longer the underdog that everyone respected, and I wasn’t ready for the resentment that followed. I was backstabbed. I was angry, my honor and reputation consequently tarnished. I resigned from the army, and when the opportunity arose to fight the war, meaning getting back at those who did that to me, well...” she laughs at the thought.</p><p>I, in return, shake my head, conflicted between two ideas: one, that she was selfish and rightfully resented, or two, that she was growing old and hurt by hard times. But I didn’t want to believe it.</p><p>	“Surely, there has to be another reason,” I say, trying to reconcile my beliefs about her, “as the people most affected by the war were not those who wronged you.”</p><p>	“I tell you there is none. But which of us was cheering on the fight all but a few moments ago? To fight against those who, ironically, benefitted the most?”</p><p>	I nod in defeat. “Albeit, if you didn’t want to fight for a good reason, you should have stayed out of it.”</p><p>	“I find it interesting that, as modestly as I can say, despite me being an invaluable resource to your side, you would rather me not fight at all than fight for personal reasons, that are not all that different from any other reason except for it not being widely held. There’s no difference between me fighting against those that backstabbed me versus someone who is fighting solely to defend their home and cultural values. Both are personal, and the meaning behind the ‘good’ in those reasons is entirely subjective, much like the reasons for the war in the first place. Fighting against the corrupt government surely is not objective, as there is no defined side one way or the other.”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 4</h3><p>	“You don’t find fighting to the public good more justifiable than starting a war out of spite? The reasons don’t need to be objective. Morality is arguably not objective, it is nearly set in stone that the desires an evil person receives from rape is not morally justifiable to all but the rapist themselves.”</p><p>	“But it’s not about the quantity of people that believe the morality to be true or not, despite the extreme case you present. That’s not how true morality is measured. It wasn’t but a millennia ago that the keeping of slaves was socially acceptable, yet the point there doesn’t need to be said aloud. And when Jesus stood before the crowd wanting to stone the prostitute, was he not the one man to say ‘he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her’? Almost to say that only he had the justification to do so, and the justification to stone everyone else there if he so pleased to say the least.”</p><p>	“That’s to argue that society’s definition of morality is incorrect,” I point out.</p><p>	“And it very well may be, and I just so happen to mostly agree with society, with whatever notability that may bring, for as soon as I stray from that path, society will do unto me what they deemed immoral. The stones will be cast at me, and I won’t have a socially accepted god to defend me from socially accepted moral values.”</p><p>	“Except that you were the socially accepted god to our side, here to sacrifice yourself on my behalf, though it wasn’t for me but for spite of the devil. And I can’t bring it upon myself to accept a sacrifice without the right reasoning behind it. It’s no different than accepting the sacrifice of a suicidal person to take your place on the electric chair, that no matter how well it may work in our respective conscious and unconscious desires, it by no means serves due on our respective contrary desires. Which by definition means one of us is in the wrong placing the conscious desire above the unconscious desire or vice versa.”</p><p>	“Or, it means it is incorrect to divvy up the rationality of the two types of desires among predefined lines without consideration for rationality behind those very desires. Just as it is incorrect to divvy up moral and immoral actions along the lines of individually and socially accepted values without consideration for how the cultural values of that society may interfere with the overall wellbeing of the collection of people within that society or societies as a whole, which is why social values are not set in stone (as much as they may be cast and enforced by the stone), and why it is so dangerous to do so even on an individual level as I fear you are doing.”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 5</h3><p>	“Yet, it is you who was causing disruption within that society as a whole with consideration for only reasons that affected you alone, who divvied up your moral values contradictory to your point.”</p><p>	She shakes her head. “First off, you’re denying the antecedent with that statement. Secondly, the point is not about how individual values supersede moral values or vice versa, or how morals should be based on how the actions may affect the society as a whole, as a single speech, no matter how true it may be, can throw that society into utter chaos. No one questions the motivations behind Martin Luther King’s contribution to the civil rights movement. For all we know, it could be based off pure spite against a couple of guys that racially discriminated against him a couple of years prior. And even though his speech threw society into chaos, it doesn’t mean the movement was morally wrong. The point I’m trying to make is if you divvied up your definition of moral actions based purely on how motivation conform to some set of predefined, constricting lines set by individual and social acceptance of the morality of the motivations, you miss the entire outcome of the actions that follow the motivations which is arguably more important.”</p><p>	“But the empirical outcome of those actions does not mirror the rational expectation of those outcomes as you are proposing. In the same way a hug coming from love means a lot different than a hug coming from sympathy, despite them both theoretically pertaining the same result. It is the empirical value that follows that matters, which is completely different in each of those scenarios. You deduce that even though your intents are different, you’re fighting the same war. You’re not. You’re fighting the same battles, sure, but not the same war. And that’s where the problem lies--in the aftermath. Will society benefit from overthrowing the corrupt government more if it was at the hands of those who wanted the better for society or those who wanted to get back at a long past foe? Would Europe have been better off under the tyrannical, genocidal grip of Stalin versus the tyrannical, genocidal grip of Hitler? And you may counter with beggars can’t be choosers, but I was never asking you to fight for me. I merely rooted for someone who I now know had only quasi-similar goals in mind. Like yay, we overthrew the corrupt government, but at what cost? And what do we gain from those costs? It just so happened things worked in our favor, considering we even won the damn war in the first place.”</p><p>	“You argue my intents were different than yours, but they weren’t. My motivations were. That’s an important distinction. My intents were the same as yours and all those on our side. And you can argue the morality behind the motivations all you want, and as you should very much like you argued the morality of the conscious and unconscious motivations in the electric chair scenario. But the intents are a whole nother game.”</p>

<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 6</h3><p>Our eyes meet in the mirror. A grin creases across her lips, and a smile with mine. She is always good at pointing out my faults, and even in the only occupation I beat her, she still finds details in the hair I miss. “I think we can both agree that intents matter more than motivations, in a sense, with regards to the outcome. But motivations are nonetheless a crucial factor in the grand scheme of things.”</p><p>“Very much so, though it is important to note that negative motivators are much more powerful than positive ones, and so while your side was much for the poor not getting their due, the true motivators were your hate towards the corrupt elite. Just as I too care about those thrown under the bus by society, the true reasons were my hate towards those that wronged me. Now, with that established, both of our motivations were based on hatred towards those that wronged us. But which would produce a more disastrous outcome on society as a whole? The reformation of society to rid itself of the elite (as corruption and elite are one in the same), or a journey on revenge that would end with the ending of the war?”</p><p>“Potentially dangerous? The former, no contest, as all revolutionary ideas are inherently dangerous to a stable life. But let me return a question. Which one would be more worth the blood of war, assuming blood could be measured in worth? The revolutionary transformation of society up towards a greater good, or one man’s vengeance trip?”</p><p>“Except there was an already existing war outside of the vengeance trip.”</p><p>“Sure, the war was being fought for something unrelated to your own goals,” I say with agreeance, “but it was still being fought, at least in some part--however little or, more likely, grand that may be--because of your vengeance trip.”</p><p>“You had to of gone into the war expecting, or hoping to all ends for, a victory, or you wouldn’t have started it in the first place. But if you wanted as little fighting as possible to achieve that victory, then you would have wanted as many allies fighting alongside you as possible for a swift victory.”</p><p>	“Even though aligning myself with the enemy of my enemy brings about a swifter victory, it does not mean they are my friend. And there’s no reason to believe they would stay or become my friend if they weren’t my friend to begin with. In fact, it’d be more likely to bring about a subsequent war if both of our end-goals were conflicting. Post-World War Two, from the western allies’ perspective, it’s great the Nazi’s were defeated, but half of Europe is still under a genocidal, tyrannical rule that hates their guts and now they have half a century of proxy-wars.”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 7</h3><p>	“But our goals were not conflicting. And the Soviet Union was drug into the war much like I was drug into yours, so the alliance was only natural. For me, there was no escape. I was an accomplished general, recently resigned from the army and living in enemy territory. Staying out of it was a hazy dream on a rainy night.”</p><p> 	“There are no rainy nights here, ma’am,” I joke, thinking back to the man who made the point linger in my mind almost to the point of an obsessive longing. It was like noticing a slant in the wall of your home with no way to fix it other than to find a new house. As remedy, I would take cold showers to simulate a freezing day, then cuddle by the fireplace that was no more than a digital feature in the wall, as fires were prohibited for obvious reasons.</p><p>I continue on a more serious note, “But there are a number of other colonies you could have moved to, all of which they wouldn’t dare upset.”</p><p>	“Is that what you tell to all whose homes were pinched by two front lines? Just find a new home?”</p><p>	“Ironic that a general is telling me a war shouldn’t be fought because some people might lose their homes. More people have lost their livelihoods because of the corruption than the war. The better of two evils.”</p><p>	“You’re choosing the better of two evils, but at the cost of others going to fight it for you who may not have made that choice, or if they had, had lost it within looking death in the face. I fought for reasons like all the others: my brothers, reputation, and honor. Not your feeble concept of justice. If you’re going to get others to do your job for you, well, beggars can’t be choosers.” </p><p>	She pauses for a moment, then continues, “I used to be the same way, though. When they nominated me to be the new president, nearly out of expectation of me to pursue it, I said no. I said I wanted to leave the politics to the politicians, that I would never have the nerve to screw with people like that. And what happened? People who didn’t quite share the same ideologies as me took over. As you point out, the aftermath can be just as difficult as the war itself when you finally come to face with your differences between your allies.”</p><p>	“And yet, despite my disagreeance with you joining the war, I always did wish you took that position.” I smile in the mirror, making the final adjustment to her hair. With our positions now transposed, I unbutton the cape and wave the snipped hair to the floor as she thanks me for another one of her favorite banters.</p>
