<p><i>Purpose: What began as a short-story exercise to better my writing skills turned into an idea for a series of short stories to explore various ideas. Remember how, at the beginning of my blog long ago, I said I wanted to start posting my writings? Well, here we are!</i></p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>As I farewell the gentle soul of an older fellow who regularly finds himself in the seat of my shop, another man enters through the automatic doors, outwardly characterized almost entirely by a nuanced gait. It’s the walk of a man alien to the red planet, yet it doesn’t follow the usual pattern of tourists or travelers from Earth, nor that of those from the upper atmosphere on Venus, nor the moons Artemis, Enceladus, Europa, Callisto, nor any other single celestial object in the solar system home to experimental or developing colonies. Rather, it looks more like all of those at once. Or, rather, none at all.</p>
<p>	“I apologize for being early,” he says, stretching his hand to greet me.</p>
<p>	“No problem, Mr. Keynes,” I return, hiding my noticing of the tattoo on his forearm. It is an older fashion, tally marks of a variety of colors each representing months long past traveling through the vast black abyss. Only, these tallies were considerably more vibrant and abundant than any I’ve seen before. Could be another fake; it isn’t all too uncommon.</p>
<p>	Tyor, my mechanical assistant, chimes as it finishes cleaning. I motion Mr. Keynes to the leather chair and throw a cape around his neck as he settles in. </p>
<p>“My hair doesn’t seem to like this atmosphere,” he chuckles as he gazes in the mirror, his short, dark, aforementioned curls a mess as though he just woke up. </p>
<p>Such remarks typically only come from the mouths of antsy tourists, self-mandated to poke at the pseudo-differences in life on another planet as if we had not heard them all before. But this man, given the tattoos on his arm are real, would not be pointing out pseudo-differences at all. He’d be one of the few living people to have truly lived a more fascinating life than anyone I’ve met, and wouldn’t bother wasting time with monotonous small-talk.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it no different than Earth’s?” I question, the razor in my hand buzzing to life. </p>
<p>	“Ah, that’s what they say. But the air grows stale, like an overly-long car ride, not to speak of the faint sulfuric odor lingering everywhere you go. There are no gusts of wind or sudden sunny showers, just the constant circulation of ventilated air that never changes a degree. Not even so much as a humid day. It’s too consistent.”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 2</h3>
<p>	“Consistency is what keeps us alive.”</p>
<p>	“It’s what kept you alive as it keeps the folks on the moon of Titan limping along, following their mundane routines religiously from a fear of waking death. But as man evolves beyond the need for such things, things that suck the life out of life itself like a parasite, why do such things dreadfully linger on like the sulfur in your air?”</p>
<p>	“Because it’s consistent, my dear fellow,” I rebut, smiling at him in the mirror. “Though, you speak of Titan as though you’ve been there?”</p>
<p>	“Indeed,” he says, then pauses for a moment. “Felt like just a couple of weeks ago, a matter of fact.”</p>
<p>	“Trips out there are usually one-way.”</p>
<p>	“Yet the ships circle around.”</p>
<p>	“Sure, but there’s not much reason to make the trip.”</p>
<p>	“That’s what people used to say about this place.”</p>
<p>	“But why go at all?” I eagerly ask again, more directly than before.</p>
<p>	His eyes perk in the mirror, perplexed. “Let me guess, is it the tallies on my arm that has piqued your curiosity?”</p>
<p>	“I’ve only met one person who has traveled such distances, and she was more so interested in the legal use of Deep Sleep than of actual travel.”</p>
<p>	He sighs. “I usually wear long sleeves, but given the circumstances…” His hand digs beneath the black cape and pulls out a clip-on name tag. I fold the tools in my hand and examine the picture of a man with remarkably no less deep eyes, no less defined jaw, no less scrupulous a cut than the one seated in front of me, despite the tag dating prior to when I first traveled here many, many years ago. Below the picture is labeled ‘John Keynes. Representative of Cryo Corp.’.</p>
<p>	Cryo Corp. is the inventor of the ‘Deep Sleep’ technology that propelled space exploration. Preceded by the Torpor technology that simply hibernates humans on and off in stages during travel, ‘Deep Sleep’ preserves the body as a whole, essentially skipping time for the users and making it possible to travel without losing precious years of life. One thing after another, and it’s now one of the largest companies in the solar system.</p>
<p>“Surely a message would suffice, given the distance,” I say, handing the card back to him.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 3</h3>
<p>	“Ah, but consistency!” Mr. Keynes shouts. “Tradition stretches generations, not distances, and the people of Titan come from the same society as you and I. Calls are delayed over such a distance, messages too machine-like, but face-to-face, man-to-man, the firm shake of a hand with friend or foe… that will never change. Humans are too social a creature.” </p>
<p>	As I finish the backside and hand him a mirror to check, I gaze through the store front windows. In the distance lies the central towers of the inner city, their spires kissing the crown of the massive, glazing geodesic dome like crystal stalagmites in a red-lit cavern, their bases descending deep beneath the Martian regolith, and their lower views enshrouded by a myriad of trees and shrubbed-roofs stretching throughout the city. </p>
<p>	Below the tree line lies a small park just outside the shop, one of the many designed to combat the claustrophobic nature of a dense city packed inside a bubble. Only a man and his dog play.</p>
<p>	Mr. Keynes laughs at the sight, and I shake my head and set the mirror on the table. </p>
<p>	“Anyway, why doesn’t the company permanently post someone in your stead?” I ask, clipping the wave of hair pinched between my fingers.</p>
<p>	“I represent the president directly for contracts of such a scale that would bankrupt the company as a whole, where corruption would be inevitable.”</p>
<p>	“You must be a rich man then,” I joke.</p>
<p>	Mr. Keynes shifts uncomfortably in his seat, hesitant to reply. “I’m a man without a home or family. It’s hard to corrupt someone who has only money and nothing else, who is no more than your assistant over there,” he says, pointing to Tyor, who bows its head and makes a sound one would relate to a whimper. “Even he doesn’t want to me be!” he exclaims, without any remorse over the subject as one would who has completely accepted the situation.</p>
<p>	“And what about your business on Titan?” I ask, moving on from the topic.</p>
<p>	“Oh, you’ll find out soon enough. Soon after I finish my business here on Mars.”</p>
<p>	“And what about your business on Mars?”</p>
<p>	“You’ll find out sometime soon after I finish my business here in your shop.”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 4</h3>
<p>	And with that, I make one final clip, then rustle my fingers through his hair to send it back to a natural state. He looks to be the same man he was in the picture and seemingly forever will be. </p>
<p>Tyor blows the bits of hair off the cape and vacuums the floor as I lead Mr. Keynes back to the front, where I present one last goodbye and watch his nuanced gait as he enters the drone transport.
