						<p>As all who wonder what beautiful specimen could have contrived of such a brilliant website name as haydengemeinhardt.github.io with some of the most organized .css files one has ever seen, here you are staring at the result of a Labor Day coding project gone wild. Well, perhaps not as “wild” as one would expect of a college student attending a university that has achieved “top party school in the country” one too many times...</p>
						<p>In all honesty though, this website has served more of a purpose than I ever planned for it to, and I truly love that you took the time to explore it!</p>
						<p> So as you may have expertly deduced, I am Hayden Gemeinhardt, a junior at LSU but only until I become a senior, and soon after that a freshman once more as I begin my voyage through graduate school. And I don’t expect it to be anything less than that--than a voyage that may take me where the waters floweth best.</p>
						<p>I aspire lead the frontier in human-robot interaction, in the implementation of assistive robotics into our society in such a way that humanity doesn’t fall suit with its sci-fi, Hollywood counterpart. They say reality is stranger than fiction, and I’ve found nothing more to be true as a history buff and bookworm. And, quite frankly, I truly do not want to see the day our society follows down a path that every single researcher I have read of fears.</p>
						<p>What role I may play among the giants of capitalism and government I do not know, but I’ll be damned if I don’t try! I don’t mean that as some whimsical New Years resolution, as it’s been my goal since day one I stepped into college after a harsh realization that the world was truly bigger than I imagined it to be. And while I still may dream bigger than the world really wants me to, I have no qualm admitting it. I’m a young writer and researcher that still gets excited at small novelties in life, what else might you expect?</p>
