						<h2>Hello there!</h2>
						<p>My name is Hayden Gemeinhardt, in case you hadn't noticed from the footer yet. I am a sophomore at LSU currently pursuing a dual degree in computer science and computer engineering with a minor in robotics. Although this is my second year at LSU, I took a handful of courses at LSU in high school and did a "Early College Option" that gave me an associates degree in general studies. So credit-wise, I'm a senior, while degree flow-chart-wise, I'm more of a junior in both of my degrees.</p>
						<p>This website is a result of two things: one, my last website looked messy, and two, I wanted to learn HTML and CSS (and now JavaScript, check out Hangman!). I just made this over the labor day weekend, so it is still in the beginning stages, but I will add more.</p>
						<p> You also may be wondering about the site name. I plan on naming this site sciencevsengineering.com (so don't steal it please!), I just don't want to spend the money quite yet, at least with it still in prototype phase.</p>
						<p>If you're still reading this, thank you for visiting and reading! You can contact me at <b>haydengemeinhardt@gmail.com</b> if you have any questions.</p>
