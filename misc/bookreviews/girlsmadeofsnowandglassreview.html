<p>
First and foremost, this is a young adult romance/magic novel written strictly for that target audience. It has received some negative reviews for that, so it’s important to go into the book with the right mindset before reading something you never wanted to read.
</p>
<p>
Given that, I absolutely loved the lax writing style. It paired well with the other book I was reading—Quantum Computing For Everyone—by giving my a nice break after an hour of matrices and linear algebra. If I ever got burdened (with any work) and wanted a quick break, I’d turn straight to this book and read a quick, short chapter.
</p>
<p>
An interesting aspect I never expected to get out of this is philosophy behind A.I. and robots. In the story (kinda spoiler, but it shows up early), there is a character able to make living things out of natural materials like sand. However, the living things aren’t necessarily “living”... depending on your point of view. It takes a toll on the heart seeing say a mouse instantly turn to sand as if it never existed, even though it never really had life… or did it? (I’ll just leave it there)
</p>
<p>
That may play an important role in the future, having to separate the emotions from robots before it can get out of hand. The day they can pass the Turing test will be an interesting day indeed.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the book does not dive deep into philosophical aspects and focuses more on presenting almost a Disney fairytale. Now, you can look at Disney movies and derive some interesting concepts, but they are left entirely up to the interpreter as if it were never intentionally put there in the first place.
</p>
<p>
I’d give this book a 5/6. Simply put, it was no breakthrough in thinking for me, but I’ll never forget some of the moments I shared with the characters.
