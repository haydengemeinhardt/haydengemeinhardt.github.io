<p>
This book read like a well-written r/eli5 (explain like I’m 5) comment on a complicated topic, spread out into a seven day read (for seven chapters). It was not strict math or a physics-jargon overload, but felt much closer to non-fiction described through the lens of fiction. In this instance, the examples used to portray the idea really helped get the initial idea across my mind, though it lacked in further developing it (something I find crucial in cementing the initial idea). Because of this, I feel like I remember considerably less than I remember from the last scientific book I read, Quantum Computing For Everyone, that was definitely not for everyone but fit within my range of knowledge considerably well and allowed me to view it as a short, summer course taken at my university. And thus, the largest downfall was simply in the book’s appeasement towards its target audience. It left me wanting more.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say this isn’t an expertly crafted text on an intriguing topic. This is one of those books I consistently set down while reading because my mind would start wandering off thinking about the topic at hand while I was simultaneously taking in new information at the same time. In fact, it was quite an unhealthy habit I acquired during the reading. My mind would simply race with ideas developed from the book and distract me from continuing reading, which is by no means a bad thing. I just wish the book also further explored the ideas as I did on my own.
</p>
<p>
The main cause for such an issue was the book’s substantial use of imagery. I cared much more about the ideas at hand than I did for the picturesque description of the examples. Again! Not a bad thing! Not many engineering/scientific writers are able to write with the same skill as her, something I personally wish to achieve in my future.
</p>
<p>
Whether anything will come from these ideas is up for debate. It’s like an Oscar Wilde quote that leaves you thinking for a moment, but improbable to make an impact on the world. But hey, who am I to say? I’m a huge proponent of raising questions and interesting ideas, and this book did exactly that, of which I was happy to be able to read near its time of publishing.
</p>
<p>
This book was an easy 5/6, only lacking from my own faults, my own lack of ability to keep focused through the imagery on an intriguing topic. I truly hope the topic opens a new world to scientific thinking.
