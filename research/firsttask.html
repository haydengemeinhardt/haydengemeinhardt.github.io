							<h1>First Task On LSU's DeepDrug Team</h1><br>
							<h2>October 2020</h2>
							<p><br>
								I'll probably write more on this somewhere else, but for the time, let me just say this is NOT what I was expecting regarding finding a position in a professors "lab". I went to the undergraduate research information fair, talked to advisors, read online forums, you name it. I wanted to get into research ASAP. Contrary to what I was told, all I had to do was ask and I would be accepted day one. At least, that is what happened here.
							</p>
							<p>
								I'm pretty sure the "interview" I was expecting went more like "tell me about yourself and I'll tell you about me, then I'll give you a task".
							</p>
							<p>
								Anyway, the first task I was given was to cleanup the dataset they were going to be using for the next part of their research. Fair enough. I was brand new to Python, literally just learning how to use Numpy, Pandas, and the sort, so really this helping me study for an upcoming midterm. Two birds with one stone, eh?
							</p>
							<p>
								<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1peEESDDSex0BNsNR2JneRVSVWDk1BNV3?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><b>Colab doc</b></a>
							</p>
							<p>
								I know, I know, it's a mess. Like I said, I was new and most of the time I spent in the document was messing around with things. However, most of what is left over is a variety of methods I was trying. 
							</p>
							<p>
								There were three things I ended up doing:
							</p>
							<p>
								1. Assigning IDs to descriptions with single terms <br> An example of a description in the dataset was: "the risk or severity of ototoxicity can be increased when drug1 is combined with drug2". Then there were subsets of sort where the severity of say ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity were increased. The goal here was to assign this description two IDs to it's "parent" descriptions, with the aforementioned being one.
							</p>
							<p>
								2. Combining to get "drugx" <br> There were two common types of descriptions. "When drug1 is combined with drug2" and "when drug2 is combined with drug1". I just combined them to "drugx combined with drugx".
							</p>
							<p>
								3. Exclude classes below the 200 threshhold <br> Given there were hundreds of thousands of combinations, there was no need to hold onto the hundreds of classes with a count of 1.
							</p>
							<p>
								As you can see, I ended up doing a few things the brute force way of going through manually. The reason being is there were a lot of typos and similar phrases in different descriptions leaving a high possible margin of error. I think it took me like an hour or two? Not too long, and that way I made sure myself there were no descriptions left unchecked. Meanwhile, the code took care of the other 80%+ of work.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now that the data was cleaned up, they could start running ML programs with much higher accuracy. Plus, I later aced my midterm in part thanks to spending all night messing around with the libraries.
