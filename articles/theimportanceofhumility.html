What better way to write my first article than to talk about humility? It is no surprise I am an amateur at best when it comes to writing. I am aware of this, perhaps too much, as I’m sure we all are. </p>
<p>
For the longest time, I was afraid to put personal works of mine anywhere outside of my password-protected documents folder. I was embarrassed, anxious, and prematurely humiliated reading back on stories or works I created, hating the idea of presenting my work and seeing people not only unimpressed, but disappointed. 
So why is it now I have become the antithesis of my former self?  The simple answer is embracing humility. The long answer—well, you need to experience it for yourself, and let me explain why you should.
</p>
<h2>What is humility?</h2>
<p>
This is my personal definition, and it will be the one I work off of:
</p>
<h3>Acknowledging that you have your flaws, while not letting it bring you down</h3><br>
<h2>Why humility is important?</h2><br>
<h3>It helps you strive to become better</h3><br>
One of the big reasons I often did not finish my works in the past was because as I read over it, I saw how poorly it was all put together. This is something we all feel, despite the contemporary gratification while writing. So why was it that afterwards, we feel the other side of the coin?
<p>
Though I may not have realized it at the time, my writing had improved a considerable amount after each story, and what I once thought was good writing no longer seemed to appease me. Thus, I would save the document one last time and begin on something new. A month later, I would make substantial progress on the work, read over it and dislike it, and so on. Rinse and repeat. Now, my documents folder is filled with 30 page stories, essays on personal tenets, and informational texts on interesting subjects, with only a handful of finished products. Each and every one better than the previous.
</p>
<p>
Some nights I love staying up late, a cup of coffee in my hand and music in the background, rereading works of mine. Of course, I feel embarrassed. I also feel the rush of nostalgia revisiting worlds I created or warmth from friendships I made with fictional characters in my writing. But I think my favorite part of it all was seeing the progression of my skills as a writer as time went on. Stories I wrote in middle school or high school amount to nothing compared to stories I write now. And though I did not write a ton, I wrote enough.
</p>
<p>
What a lot of people do not realize is finishing stories you write when you are still developing your skills as a writer is not all that important. What is important is that you keep writing. If starting a new topic keeps you writing, good. Better to start anew than the alternative forcing yourself to finish the story, dropping the quality of your writing and ruining your desire to do it again, like overplaying a videogame you don’t truly like in order to 100% the campaign then feeling like a waste afterwards.
</p>
<p>
Most people who write will realize they have their downfalls, but let it take them down and never write again. You need to be able to say, “Yeah, this sucks, but I grew and I’m still going to try again anyway”.
</p>

<h3>Helps to allow you to see things from another perspective</h3>
<p>
This is almost the converse of the previous point. Most people will be so confident in their arguments, they never acknowledge their flaws.
Without getting too far off topic here, this is what I believe is the biggest problem with politics, though I will talk about this more in depth in another post. If you can never see a situation in which you are wrong, how do you expect to truly see the situation from the other person’s perspective? If you cannot see from their perspective, you will never be able to counter their arguments in the best way possible, and you will never be able to admit you are wrong. And if you have never admitted you are wrong or changed your viewpoint, you are doing something incorrectly in life.
</p>
<h3>It gives you confidence</h3>
<p>
Before writing this, I read other related articles in order to do a little research. After roughly a dozen, I realized not one mentioned the gain in confidence you receive after embracing humility. This newfound confidence was a big thing for me as I grew as a person by accepting humility in my life. Though it could just be me, I believe many others will find the same idea.
</p>
<p>
I have been doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for a few years now. For those that do not know, BJJ is probably the one of the most humbling things you will ever experience. Ask anyone that has ever done it. The reason being, everyone will beat you time and time again in your first year or so. I mean everyone, and it won’t even be close. I’ve seen countless times where a 200+ pound dude will walk in and get submitted a handful of times by 150 pound blue belt in less than five minutes.
</p>
<p>
Humility is necessary for BJJ. If you never embrace it, you will always go home disappointed in yourself. There will always be someone better than you, and you simply have to accept that. However, another big part of BJJ is the increase in confidence you gain after doing it for a while. How can that be?
</p>
<p>
It is fairly simple. Once you accept that you will get beat, you no longer roll with someone expecting to win. Winning becomes irrelevant and instead, you focus on improving your skills. Given some time, your skills improve massively, and suddenly you become the hammer to the nails of the new guys walking in.
</p>
<p>
Of course, you can become better by trying to win every single roll. But trust me, those who focus more on skills progress at least two fold faster than the others. You have to have humility to give up dominant positions to train getting out of weaker ones. You have to have humility to roll against someone you know will crush you to learn from your mistakes. You have to have humility to accept getting beat by someone you shouldn’t and then pick yourself up and keep training. If you do not have humility, you will likely either progress very slowly or give up. I see it all the time. However, if you embrace the humility and strive to get better, you will become much better and gain a lot of newfound confidence.
</p>

<h3>Before overcoming a problem, you must first realize you have a problem<h3>
<p>
We have all experienced the type of people who are too stubborn to admit or even realize their downfalls. I can name a couple of people that come to my mind already. I am not sure if there is anything more aggravating than trying to deal with someone who needs to fix something wrong with them but are too narcissistic or stubborn to realize it. That is the problem with stubbornness- you are too stubborn to realize you are being stubborn about being stubborn. With a little sincere humility in your life, it is a lot easier to deal with personal issues like that
</p>
<h3>It helps control your emotions</h3>
<p>
As a child, I had some terrible anger issues. Luckily, I quickly got over that and I am now one of the harder people to make mad you will ever meet. I had to learn to accept things not going how I wanted in life, to obey authority, and to be able to accept consequences and move on. This is one of the baseline principles of humility, and those who do not have it often live worse off and can even make life worse for those around them.
</p>
<p>
I believe a great example of this is in video games. The toxicity and salt that plagues online games almost ruins the games entirely. It is almost always because someone loses, and that person will proceed to blame the loss on everybody but themselves, as if they had a perfect game and yelling at the team will magically fix things. What needs to happen if you find yourself in that situation is you need to own up to your mistakes and move on with life. The problem is no one has any humility and they cannot take losing, so now the game has to be ruined for you and everyone you are playing with. This is also very similar to BJJ as I talked about earlier. You will never win every game, and there will always be someone better than you. Getting upset over these two facts is childish.
</p>

<h3>“Trying to maintain a false confidence often may build temporary successes, but it makes every failure harder to recover from.” Scott H Young</h3>
<p>
This is a quote I found in one of the articles I read beforehand, and it was too good to pass up. 
</p>
<p>
It is no doubt confidence is a very important trait. Otherwise, I would not have mentioned it earlier. However, holding a false confidence is like putting on a fake face to hide your emotions. You may get through the day without falling apart, but ultimately it does more harm than good as those emotions simply build up inside of you, and they will be let out one way or another. You are running away from the problem, and the problem is destined to catch up. You might as well take it on now instead of wearing yourself out first.
</p>

<h3>Live to fight another day</h3>
<p>
You may not see the results immediately. Much like working out, you have to go through the hard part first. But if you truly want to better yourself, next time you are in an argument, try admitting you are wrong and see how things go. 
</p>
<p>
Oh, and don’t mention it to anyone.
