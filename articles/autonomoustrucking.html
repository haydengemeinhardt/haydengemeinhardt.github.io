	Andrew Yang in the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination race was a breath of fresh air amongst the opposing lifetime politicians. Although I am unsure if I would have voted for him, I did enjoy the ideas he brought to the table.
</p>
<p>
	Undoubtedly, his most popular platform idea was universal basic income. While that is a topic which not only I could write a book on, but also highly unqualified to talk about, I wanted to discuss what he often used to support it—the future of self-driving trucks.
</p>
<p>
	Around mid last decade, companies such as Daimler, Tu Simple, Embark and Tesla began researching and rolling out prototypes. Now, you are starting to hear many stories like this one: “UPS self-driving delivery trucks are on the road”. Tu Simple already has forty trucks in use with ten more coming later in the year. More than likely, some form self-driving trucks will start to become the norm by the end of the decade.
</p>
<p>
	<h2>With 3.5 million truck drivers making the occupation the largest in the U.S., shouldn’t we be worried?</h2>
</p>
<p>
	Yes and no.
</p>
<p>
	First, let’s go over the different levels of autonomous vehicles:
</p>
<p>
<hr>
	Level 0- No automation: Self explanatory.
<hr>
	Level 1- Driver Assistance: In almost every modern car, this includes lane assistance and cruise control.
<hr>
	Level 2- Partial Driving Automation: Pretty much what we think of in current Teslas. The vehicle can control steering and acceleration/deceleration.
<hr>
	Level 3- Conditional Driving Automation: The vehicle can make the drive from point a to b in certain ideal conditions and has the capability to start making decisions for themselves, like passing a slow moving car. The driver could watch a movie or sit on their phone if they wanted. The 2019 Audi A8L is the first commercial car to have this capability (though only in some places like Germany due to laws), while other companies are planning to release this in 2020.
<hr>
	Level 4- High Driving Automation: The vehicle can drive itself in most scenarios and has the ability to intervene in many cases if something goes wrong. Legislation and infrastructure is currently holding this level back, as some companies have about achieved this level and can only do it in limited areas. You would still need driver attention regardless, just in case.
<hr>
	Level 5- Full Driving Automation: These vehicles do not need any human intervention, and could remove the steering wheel and pedals if they wanted to (or weren’t bound by laws). Still in very early testing.
<hr>
</p>
<p>
	Level 5 vehicles are still many years away from existing, let alone being used or even allowed to use on the roads. These are the vehicles that you would need to worry about starting to take away jobs. All of the others would still require a driver present, at the very least due to legislation. Frankly, I can’t see the U.S. government allowing level 5 vehicles to run without a driver for a long time anyway.
</p>
<p>
	We see current technology already allowing automated trips, but this is only on highways/interstates. Trucks driving in an urban area or on local streets where human intuition is needed are a lot farther away than any level 5 car, despite autonomous truck technology being ahead of cars at the moment. This is due to how complicated driving an 80,000 pound semi can be.
</p>
<p>
	And this is only for ideal conditions. With rain or snow, the hardware may not be able to see. Or if there is a tornado warning, the robot may not know where to park. Weigh stations will need to be upgraded, and some form of help will be needed to refuel the vehicle. And what happens if a truck gets into an accident or hits a pedestrian? What if it gets a flat tire but has no where to pull over? What if there is a vehicle stopped in the road, can the truck distinguish it from say a bus only temporarily letting passengers off and stop for it? What if the road is old and a lot of the lines are hard to see? What happens if a stop sign is knocked down or the traffic lights are broken due to a power outage? Better yet, what happens when an emergency vehicle needs to get around the truck on a tight road? How can the truck watch out for unpredictable pedestrians, perhaps one going behind a car the cameras may not be able to pick up but we can?
</p>
<p>
	It can be easy to say that AI technology has advanced so fast in the last few years that it won’t take long to iron out these scenarios, but sensor technology (the hardware side of things) is long from it, and sensors have been in research for decades.
</p>
<p>
	You also need to take into account the time and money it would take to replace the millions of already existing trucks. Once the technology becomes available, which could take years, it would take even longer to replace a considerable amount of the trucks.
</p>
<p>
	A company would also be very unlikely to spend the money to replace trucks with self-driving capabilities if they still require a driver to be present. We may have the ability to use level 5 technology in the next decade, but do we expect legislation to allow that? I’m not sure anyone has the answer. 
</p>
<p>
	Optimism in the industry has quickly ground to a halt in the last couple of years as these realizations have come to play. Robert Brown, head of government relations and public affairs for Tu Simple, states “Level 5 trucks are most likely decades upon decades upon decades away.” We can take that with a grain of salt given his position, but Jim Hackett, CEO of Ford, agrees with him to an extent, stating “We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles […] because the problem is so complex.” Leaders like Waymo and GM have even missed self-imposed deadlines in 2018 and 2019 respectively for self-driving taxi services, of which is much simpler than truck driving.
</p>
<p>
	Short term (10-15 years), I believe we do not need to worry about the capability of self-driving trucks threatening a loss of jobs and I do not think legislation will allow that to happen anytime soon even if the technology comes in less than a decade AND companies begin large-scale replacement of trucks.
</p>
<p>
	However, long term (25+ years), I do believe this can and will become a much larger issue in the trucking world.
</p>
<p>
	Now, other automation, like auto ordering at fast food restaurants or self checkout at supermarkets, is something we should be talking about more so than automated trucks.
