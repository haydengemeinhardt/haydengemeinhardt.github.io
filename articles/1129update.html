							<h1>Updates To Website</h1><br>
							<h2>By: Hayden Gemeinhardt | November 29, 2020</h2>
							<p><br>
							My first major update since I created this website on github! Which is also the reason I haven't had a post in a bit.
</p>
							<p>
							For the most noticable one, I changed the style of the pages to look less... lackluster? I'm not sure which word to use, but it looks a lot better. I kept the old style with things like blogs just because I find it easier to read.
							</p>
							<p>
							There is now also a research tab! I'm going to try to document all of the work I've done in research at LSU, starting from when I joined the DeepDrug team back in October.
							</p>
							<p>
							A smaller change, but one I'm glad about, is the memory game is now fixed. I am still not sure why it was (quite literally) randomly breaking to be honest, but upon fixing the issue, I was surprised it worked in the first place. It only took me a month or two to figure out haha.....
							</p>
							<p>
							Anywho, I finally registered the domain with Google's search engine. Supposedly. I still need to work out a couple of kinks, but that will come after finals right around the corner here.
							</p>
							<p>
							That's all I have for now. I am really enjoying the way this website is turning out. It has exceeded expectations already!
