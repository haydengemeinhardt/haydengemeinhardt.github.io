							<h1>Why Laptop Gaming Is (Usually) Not A Good Idea</h1><br>

I want to emphasize generally here, as everyone’s situation differs. I, for one, am currently using a gaming laptop after coming from a PC, and I do not regret it. I am away at my university for a good part of each week, so it is nice being able to do something during breaks outside of ten straight hours of studying. Many of my peers do the same. Another example is a friend of mine likes playing games in bed, and they are willing to pay the extra money to have that luxury. Others simply have the money to not worry about spending a few hundred extra dollars.
</p>
<p>
Often the problem you will find with gaming laptops is they are more expensive than their PC counterparts and not upgradable. They also tend to have heating issues and poor battery life (Usually a couple of hours). In case you didn’t know, you can’t even game while unplugged, as it switches the graphics card off. And for decent build quality, you have to dish out a lot more money.
</p>
<p>
Thus, every online forum you visit will bash gaming laptops.
</p>
<p>
Now, there are pros to gaming laptops. You can carry them anywhere you go, the obvious reason you would want one. A lot of people need laptops anyway, and go for the two-in-one (this is only financially good short-term). There are also people who don’t know how to build or upgrade a PC, and don’t want to learn how either. In this case, this whole article may be pointless. I’m not sure about the pricing on prebuilt PCs, but by looks they are slightly more expensive than custom but cheaper than laptops. And if you don’t know how to upgrade, well, having a separate laptop and gaming PC may end up being more expensive, depending on how often you upgrade.
</p>
<p>
You may value the convenience of gaming laptops over the cost and hassle of PCs. And if you don’t play performance intensive games often, building a nice PC and buying a separate work laptop may be a waste of time.
</p>
<h2>Cheap Gaming Laptops</h2>
<p>
There are “cheap” gaming laptops, though these cut corners to get that price. This is usually in specs and build quality. Heating is also a very big problem in these.
For example, let’s take a look at the Dell G5 Special Edition. The G5 SE is the world’s first gaming laptop to utilize an AMD CPU and GPU. AMD is known to give the same performance at a cheaper cost compared to intel (who has a monopoly on the laptop market). The G5 SE also has really poor build quality (cheap plastic) and really bad heating issues. These two things allow this to be about the best price-to-performance gaming laptop you will find, but on paper alone.

<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5 4600H processor</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX 5600M graphics card</li>
<li>16 GB DDR4 RAM</li>
<li>256 GB SSD</li>
<li>1080p 120 Hz display</li>
</ul>
For $880

<p> For a comparison, I made a quick PC build. </p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU ($167)</li>
<li>Radeon RX 5600 XT GPU ($280)</li>
<li>MSI B450 Tomahawk ATX motherboard ($115)</li>
<li>G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 16 GB DDR4-3200 RAM ($65)</li>
<li>Western Digital Blue 1 TB M.2 SSD ($120)</li>
<li>Aerocool Bolt ATX Tower Case ($56)</li>
<li>Cooler Master MWE 650 W ATX power supply ($100)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For $903
</p>
<p>
My build is slightly faster, by about 7-10 percent using online benchmarks provided by other users, and has quadruple the storage space (256GB won’t get you very far nowadays). Plus, you won’t have to worry about heating issues or cheap plastic hinges. And it doesn’t look straight out of a 80s Sci-fi.
</p>
<h2>More Reasonable Laptop</h2>
<p>
If you want decent specs with decent build quality, well you’re going to have to raise your price. The new ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 was one of the most highly anticipated laptops this year after it was revealed to use AMD’s new CPU (nicknamed intel killer). It is a smaller, lighter laptop, with decent thermals and a sick design (you can have animations on the back. It is so cool).
</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS</li>
<li>Nvidia RTX 2060 Max Q</li>
<li>16 GB DDR4 RAM</li>
<li>1 TB SSD (yes!)</li>
<li>1080p 120Hz (slow response time unfortunately)</li>
</ul>
<p>For $1400…</p>

<p>A PC comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU ($275)</li>
<li>Gigabyte Geforce RTX 2070 SUPER GPU ($500)</li>
<li>Gigabyte X570 ATX AM4 motherboard ($200)</li>
<li>G.Skill Ripjaws V 16 GB DDR4-3600 RAM ($80)</li>
<li>Western Digital Blue 1 TB M.2 SSD ($120)</li>
<li>NZXT H510 ATX Mid Tower Case ($70)</li>
<li>Cooler Master MWE 650 W ATX power supply ($100)</li>
<li>be quiet! Dark Rock 4 CPU cooler ($75)</li>
</ul>
<p>For $1420</p>
<p>In this build, the CPU is about the same, but the GPU is a massive upgrade. Heck, you could also take out the CPU cooler, use the stock cooler (what the cpu comes with for free), and avoid overclocking to save some money. Or you could get a cheaper CPU, take out the cooler, and upgrade the graphics card… It is just so much more fun to build your own PC!</p>
<p>
In both of these PC builds, I exclude monitor, mouse, keyboard, etc. I expect you to have a mouse and keyboard already (they’re very cheap). Monitors are usually excluded from PC builds, for numerous reasons (mainly you don’t upgrade them often), but if you do not already have a monitor, you will have to keep that in mind. PC monitors are so much nicer, so in my opinion it’s worth the extra price. Also, a lot of people (me) like hooking their laptop up to a desk set up when they get home, so the cost will be there anyway.
</p>
<p>
The real benefit of PCs versus laptops is long term. In three or four years, your GPU and CPU will be out of date. Instead of buying an entirely new system, PCs can keep everything the same and simply change those two out (about 50% the cost), while laptops you have to buy a whole new system. So if you like your $1400 systems, you save $700 dollars going the PC route. You get to keep your screen and case without having to worry about heating or cheap plastic, but you can’t carry it around. And, you have better quality at the same price point. Keep in mind though, your work laptop may need upgrading too.
</p>
<p>It all boils down to this</p>
<p>If you are out of the house very often, don’t care about getting 150+ FPS, and don’t want the hassle of custom built PCs, and not too tight on money, laptop gaming IS the way to go.</p>
<p>If you only game at home, play graphic intensive games, are willing to spend a day learning to build your own PC, and want to save a few hundred dollars long-term, then PC gaming is the way to go.</p>

<p>It really depends on what you value in a computer, but most gamers will typically benefit from custom built PCs.</p>
