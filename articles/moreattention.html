							<h1>[Blank] Should Get More Attention</h1><br>

	The other day, I went to go read some computer science blogs. One of them I read was Computational Complexity. It had a lot of interesting articles, and a lot of not-so-interesting articles. One of the posts I read was, “Can you name a famous living Chemist? Can anyone?”
</p>
<p>
	They were re-watching a Jeopardy championship when a category in chemistry had a special guest read the clues. Turned out to be Bryan Cranston, the guy who played Walter White on Breaking Bad. This sparked a question in the author, “why couldn’t they get a famous living chemist to read the clues?” The obvious answer to this was there are no famous living chemists, and in fact, not really any living scientists.
</p>
<p>
	And… that was about as insightful as the post got. 
</p>
<p>
To his credit, he said he was not pushing an agenda and I respect that. No, like I really respect that. I am so sick and tired of hearing about how we need to make science a bigger priority and everyone should know famous scientists and this and that. 
</p>
<p>
You can say the same thing about everything. [blank] needs to have a higher priority. Prison reform, fact-based journalism, support for veterans, mental healthcare. Yes, we all agree these things are important.
</p>
<p>
	News flash- most people don’t have the education, interest, or time to understand most research that is done. A lack of means, motive, and opportunity. And the same goes with just about everything else you put in that blank.
</p>
<p>
That is why nearly all famous living scientists are not really scientists. Neil deGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye, Richard Dawkins, even prominent figures like Carl Sagan and Stephen Hawking, are famous for their communication of science to the public more so than their actual contributions to the fundamental ideas of science. Of course, that can be argued, but from my understanding, it seems to be the case.
</p>
<p>
What needs to happen is showing, not telling. Show me that this thing needs more attention, and show me why we should give it more attention than something else. You know why Black Lives Matter is getting everyone’s attention right now? Because we are being shown.
</p>
<p>
People like Richard Dawkins and Bill Nye made things interesting and easy to understand. Not by telling us science is interesting and comprehensible, but by showing us. We simply do not have the time or resources to give everything the attention that it needs. So please, stop wasting my time saying I need to give something a higher priority and show me why it needs my attention.
