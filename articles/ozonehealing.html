							<h1>The Healing of the Ozone Layer</h1><br>

	The healing of the Ozone Layer has been arguably the greatest achievement mankind has obtained in the last couple of decades in regard to climate change. Countries around the world have worked together to reduce and eliminate the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that were destroying our ozone.
</p>
<p>
This all started during the early 20th century when many people were transferring from ice boxes to refrigerators. In response, there was a need for refrigerants, and thus the DuPont Company developed hydrochlorofluorocarbons. Then, aerosol spray products like hairspray used compounds such as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12). The demand for CFCs only got greater.
</p>
<p>
These compounds are nontoxic, nonflammable, and easily converted from liquid to gas, therefore making them ideal for these appliances. However, they are very toxic and very harmful for our atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
CFCs slowly rise into the stratosphere and are broken up by ultraviolent radiation (for example, dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2) breaks into Cl and Chlorodifluoromethyl radical (CClF2). This releases the chlorine atom (Cl) which then combine with ozone (O3) to create chlorine monoxide (ClO) and oxygen (O2), ultimately depleting the ozone layer of molecules.
</p>
<p>
It was not realized until 1974 that CFCs were causing this major issue, and in 1985, a paper by the British Antarctic Survey found that the ozone over Antarctica had been dropping steeply since the 1970s. 
</p>
<p>
In 1987, many countries came together to create the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer to begin eliminating the use of CFCs. For many years, it was unclear if the agreement had actually been effective which led to a lot of denial around the topic. One argument to help explain the lack of evidence on effectiveness said that the gasses can take over a decade to rise into the atmosphere and an effect would take even longer to notice. Howeveryy, the longer it took, the more people began to deny. I can personally recall this debate becoming increasingly hot during my years up through middle school in science class, as the evidence was lacking.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in 2014, scientists found the first small increases in the ozone. And in 2016, more evidence was revealed that the Ozone hole had healed a size equal to half of the continental U.S. and was on track to fully heal between 2040 and 2070. This was enough to confidently decide that the measures were indeed working.
</p>
<p>
We always hear pessimistic and depressing news about climate change, but this is one of those amazing stories that deserves more attention. Shedding more hope on the issue may help increase support on the idea that humans can do something about destroying the Earth, that the destruction is not inevitable. 
</p>
<p>
We can do something about this. We just have to choose worthwhile things to do and remember that healing is a long term goal. You do not become rich overnight, nor do you heal a knee in a week. But if you do not try to become rich or never let your knee heal, well, it will not happen on its own.
