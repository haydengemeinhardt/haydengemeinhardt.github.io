<p><i>Purpose: The last two conversations had little to do with robots so I tried bringing this in, but I wrote this while reading Descartes' Discourse on Method and it ended up getting out of hand...</i></p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Not all customers love to silently browse their phones or awkwardly gaze their eyes around the room while somewhat holding their head still, nor do they belong to the few that love to banter in the chair or talk of past travel. Rather, at least with one man in particular, some tend to treat the haircuts as a therapy lesson with the benefits of trust and a private room, which I enjoy much more than a typical small-talk or silent service. Plus, they tend to leave great tips.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased to see you again, Luis!” I exclaim.</p>
<p>His blue eyes briefly greet mine then waver back to the floor, his shoulders slumped and expression frowning. Unfortunately, it’s not unusual.</p>
<p>Tyor chimes and I lead Luis over to be seated. “The usual cut?” I ask.</p>
<p>“No, actually. Just do something different.”</p>
<p>I nod and spray his hair with water. “So, what’s going on today?”</p>
<p>His chin rises from his inflating chest with a long, deep sigh, though no words come out with his breath.</p>
<p>I set the bottle on the table and lift my scissors with its silver composition glimmering the overhead lights into the mirror, hoping a reminder of his surrounding will ease his nerves. Snippets of hair begin to float to the floor as I patiently wait for his response.</p>
<p>“Do you or Tyor mind if I smoke?” he asks.</p>
<p>“Of course,” I say, flipping on the overhead filtration vents. “Whatever makes you feel at home.”</p>
<p>As he shuffles a cigarette out of a pack under the cloak, Tyor walks over to light it with a flick of friction. Even though fire is illegal outside of Earth, no politician is bold enough to enforce it, so it’s a simple software download onto Tyor. Business is business.</p>
<p>“I’ve known you a long time,” Luis says in between a puff of gray smoke spiraling up to the rectangular cutouts in the ceiling. “For as long as I’ve known this glass dome that stands between us and the infinite vacuum. A month after I got off that dreaded ship if you remember--I found the most beautiful woman and came directly to you to set my hair straight.”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 2</h3>
<p>I remember all too well—with him returning the next month and telling me how disastrous it went—yet I still listen with the same attentiveness as though I didn’t.</p>
<p>	“Still, I’ve fucked up worse than ever,” Luis stammers, flicking ashes in the tray Tyor fetched for him with a polite smile, “and this may be the last time I see you.”</p>
<p>	“You’ve been a loyal customer of mine for years, so if there is anything I can do to keep that, I’m more than willing to help.”</p>
<p>	He laughs at the thought, with a following fleeting startle as police drones whine in the distance. “I wish that were so,” he says.</p>
<p>	Luis was always a troubled figure. A mind lost in the impossible task of deciphering the divide between consciousness and the cosmos. A mind pricking and prying for any conceivable, jargoned concept of what it means to be human that couldn’t simply be programmed onto a silicon chip in a lone line of code. But he was never one to need that kind of help. I guess every shoreline eventually hits its deep drop off the further one wanders from its beach.</p>
<p>	“I killed someone last night,” he stammers, a tremble shivering through his hair to my fingertips.</p>
<p>	“You? You of all people?”</p>
<p>	“It was an accident, I tell you! An accident! Just a nudge of the elbow… I wasn’t paying attention. And what was I to do then? What does one do? Frantically try to save them when it’s far too late? Between that and the internal debate about whether to call emergency services. Maybe it isn’t too late, maybe they can be saved, however unlikely, but consequently forfeit your life to society’s blind iron clutch. Or you can run and hide, hoping to salvage what little life can be saved from that unbearable situation. How does one answer philosophy’s great question on an adrenaline-induced, heart-rending whim?”</p>
<p>	Luis inhales deeply then lets a great puff of smoke cloud the mirror. It slowly escapes to the ceiling, revealing a doleful tear descending his cheek. What doubt I had in his shrouded claims provisionally recede with the smoke.</p>
<p>	“How did such things happen?”</p>
<p>	“I told you, my clumsy elbow and a careless placement of a glass of water.” He shakes his head as I pull the scissors back in confusion. “And the poor guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Surprised me with a beep. Innocent as a butterfly yet lost in a flood. It was an accident…”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 3</h3>
<p>	Luis repeats the accident as if explaining his actions before a judge. But if I am a judge, I am a clueless judge, as I don’t understand what sentence he is hoping to reduce. Rather, I feel like a parent listening to their child frantically explain why the computer’s keyboard isn’t working.</p>
<p>	“Luis, you didn’t actually kill someone, did you?”</p>
<p>	“Dr. Fenster, when have I ever lied to you?”</p>
<p>	“You know I don’t like it when you call me that.”</p>
<p>	“And I don’t appreciate you making a mocking of me. So why must you do so?”</p>
<p>	“Maybe I’m trying to salvage the situation as you did. Maybe I long for a hoping that what you have told me isn’t what I initially feared it was. I don’t want to believe you killed a man. But that doesn’t mean I’m making a mocking out of you.”</p>
<p>	“I never said I killed a man. But it’s as if the stormy sands above have condensed to gray clouds. My heart aches…”</p>
<p>	The melancholic melodrama lingers on like an overdrawn symphony, like an augmentation for Vivaldi’s seasons as compliment to the Martian dance around the sun. A few long minutes pass </p>
<p>Finally, he stops and gives one last puff of the cigarette before twisting it in the ash of the tray. Tyor sets the tray on a nearby table, adding it to the heap of chores at closing time, and turns off the ventilation that, along with the asking of a smoke, signaled him to get the tray earlier.</p>
<p>	After recomposing himself, Luis signals to Tyor then signs “don’t listen” with his hands. An orange light glows next to the grille of Tyor’s microphone, and the shades darken the room as the interior lights shimmer to life.</p>
<p>	He really is mad. “Surely you realize this is overboard—”</p>
<p>	“It’s not about that,” Luis interrupts. “Well, in a way, but… It-it’s confidential. I’m not taking the risk.”</p>
<p>	“You’re a professor for the local university, how confidential could it be?”</p>
<p>	“Was a professor… I remember the stories about you, you know,” he says, once again redirecting the conversation along his own winding path, unbeknownst to me whether it is purposefully or due to his withering social skills. “Brilliant, respected, yet independent to a fault…”</p>
<p>	“No need to sugar coat it.”</p>

<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 4</h3>
<p>	“And when you challenged the popular ideas, what happened?” he yells with no expectation of a response. “Society kicked you to the curb. No different than what happened to Galileo, yet everyone acts higher than the society that persecuted Galileo when they are one in the same. It’s human condition, not societal condition, that pursues this madness.”</p>
<p>	I nod as I finish his hair but continue making small adjustments as to not break his thought.</p>
<p>	“I took after you and proposed a paper to the head of my department. At first, she laughed, going on and on about how this contradicts decades of research aimed directly at this topic, ignoring the fact I raised multiple times that the decades of research she adduced took place decades ago when technology was not yet advanced enough to handle the complexity of the human brain. So, I brought it to neurological colleagues of mine who then assured me the idea was a fundamental misunderstanding that hadn’t been asked a thousand times, but they couldn’t give me a strong explanation as to why that was the case.”</p>
<p>	“You know as well as I do, Dr. Fenster, that it was the topic of the century, but when part of the community came to agree it to be a desolate road, it fell apart like a desolate road, and now any man who brings the idea back to the forefront is deemed delusional or benighted. And it’s all behind bureaucratic red tape you’d expect from a legal proceeding as though we were opening a case to prove Manson’s innocence, not the disappointment that is the scientific community.”</p>
<p>	Luis, realizing I’m finished his hair, takes off the apron and rises from the seat. He dusts the remnants off of his neck as he walks to a table near the front and pours a cup of coffee. He doesn’t particularly enjoy the drink, but it is his way of asking me to indulge him with talk everyone else is quicker to counter than to listen. I lay my scissors in front of the mirror and let Tyor clean up while I move to lean against the front table next to Luis.</p>
<p>	“I almost forgot to mention,” he says, laughing between sips, “the work I’m exploring is the idea of consciousness by recreating a human mind within a computer. You know, work that has been tabled for years, work that no one is bold enough to touch with a ten foot pole, work that would make you lose all credibility in your field… You ever hear the story about Semmelweis?”</p>
<p>	I shake my head, laying the tools out for Tyor to clean as the day ends.</p>
</div></div>

<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 5</h3>
<p>	“He gave empirical evidence that washing your hands reduces the number of deaths in hospitals. However, he couldn’t provide a rational explanation and his work was rejected, despite the reduction of mortality rates in his ward. He became depressed about the rejection of his work, so a fellow doctor lured him into an insane asylum, where he was beaten after trying to escape and died to his injuries. And when the ward discarded his ideas now that he was gone, mortality rates increased by a factor of six, yet no one batted an eye.”</p>
<p>	“Doctors, of all people, were given hard evidence, yet it wasn’t until decades after his discovery that they accepted it. And these aren’t separate, anecdotal cases. Gregor Mendel, William Harvey, William Coley, Alfred Wegner, Francis Rous, Hans Krebs, Richard Ernst, Louis Pasteur… You can write the entirety of modern science through rejected ideas alone, so you think by now we would learn maybe, just maybe, that perhaps we should hear scientists out before outright rejecting ideas that challenge our beliefs. Yet, here we fucking are!”</p>
<p>	From the higher up’s point of view, a socially awkward man who cries over the short-circuiting of a copmuter petitions to resume research into a notorious topic that everyone else presumes irrational. It’s almost no wonder why they reject the idea based off of a premeditated bias against the proponent himself, but how much of the rejection was about the idea?</p>
<p>	“Serious research into neural networks began early in the age of computers, but the funding went dry in the late nineteen sixties after a number of researchers who touted more than reasonable optimistic hopes later only showed near fraudulent progress after the unfortunate discovery of computational complexity. But once technology caught up, it became a peak area of research. In a very similar scope, serious research into simulating the human brain began in two-thousand thirteen when the European Commission granted a billion euros for the ‘Human Brain Project’. Unfortunately, it was an inauspicious start. But I believe our technology has caught up…”</p>
<p>	“When did you propose the research?” I cut in, folding my arms.</p>
<p>	“Oh, right, well, that all took place a while ago. After a few rejections, I finally decided to contact a friend of mine in Cryo Corp, the only company with enough money to throw at research like this with little care. By then, I had already followed in the footsteps of a landmark study published near the initial surge of interest in this idea in twenty-nineteen, where a team fully recreated a ragworm’s neurological system. First, however, is that it’s merely three hundred neurons, miniscule compared to the human brain’s 86 billion neurons and numerous other complex counterparts. Secondly, it took almost twenty years between that project, ‘Connectome 2.0’, and its predecessor, ‘Connectome 1.0’, to achieve the mapping they wanted, and even longer to interpret the results.”</p>
</div></div>
<div class="card"><div class="prose">
<h3 style="text-align: right">Page 6</h3>
<p>	“And third, there proved to be no motive to pursue the research to the point I want to reach after the failure of the ‘Human Brain Project’. The general consensus came to things like ‘Biology is matter that has meaning. Simulating the tissue is doable, but meaningless.’ and ‘it is an overengineered answer to a nonexistent question’ and…”</p>
<p>	“Luis!” I interrupt.</p>
<p>	“Right, right, sorry. I was saying I followed their footsteps; I used their mapping of each neuron and created a program that can provide real time feedback system that simplifies the impulses into understandable behavior. Remember, there’s no need to simulate the worm if you can just measure a real one. The issue is we cannot understand the complexities behind the connections between each neuron and how they work, in the very same way we can’t understand the black boxes of most A.I. But my area of research just so happens to land in the principle of transparency of A.I., simplifying those black boxes.”</p>
<p>“Your work in that landscape is revolutionary,” I compliment. “As you brought up before, if one is to be judged guilty by an A.I., surely one would want to know why or how it came to that conclusion.”</p>
<p>“Exactly! The same principles can be applied to biology. If one is to be judged guilty by a human mind, surely one would want to know why or how it came to that conclusion. And sure, we have speech to communicate thoughts in ways a computer can’t yet, however we don’t all agree on moral values. Speech has served its purpose, but I think it’s time to fill in the gaps in the reasoning it leaves because if it was straightforward there would be no need to debate its semantics and intricacies. No better way to do that than go directly to the source of reasoning itself. You see, it’s not about simulating the mind, it’s about mapping and finding the algorithms behind its inner self.”</p>
<p>I bring my hand from my folded arms to my chin. “Algorithms? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“In a neural network, say constant algorithms for our purposes as I have yet to work with active learning algorithms, there is a specific function created from a set of inputs and outputs. My research was aimed at simplifying those functions to human-interpretation. But say we were looking at the function of happiness in the human mind. We know what inputs, such as an achievement, that can garner the output of happiness, but we don’t quite understand the function itself. If we can map the neurological network behind happiness, I believe I can similarly simplify that function in one way or another so that we understand from the source itself, bit by bit, why achievements bring happiness. Then possibilities open up. Endless possibilities.”</p>
<p>	“And how is this confidential?”</p>

<p>Luis looks to the drawn curtains and sighs, taking a number of sips before returning an answer. “Cryo Corp has already… they have already simulated the human mind, to an extent. It is a very dull mind with no motor skills or anything of the such. Much like a man in a vegetable state. And they can’t seem to learn anything from it. Well, the computer I ruined was running one of those simulations—"</p>
<p>“You believe a life was in that mind?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure… it’s just… just… different. And I can’t imagine the media attention, the ethic committees, the lawsuits that would be brought upon my team if word got out about the research. Hell, even I don’t know half of the research half as well as I’d like to know—"</p>
<p>“And you know less than half of the research half as well as it deserves,” I finish.</p>
<p>Luis smiles and nods. “But, like they say, easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.”</p>
<p>“Well, not if it’s a trillion dollar lawsuit.”</p>
<p>“You underestimate how much the rich and powerful can get away with things. Half a glimpse at the two-thousand and eight depression in the U.S. will tell you that much. Regardless, I’m not sure leaving the ethics of… whatever this is, is best left in the hands of corrupt politicians.”</p>
<p>	“Not much better in a corrupt corporation either.”</p>
<p>	“Perhaps that’s a talk for another time. Regardless, I should get going.” Luis motions to Tyor, and the descending sun floods the room once more. After tossing the cup into the mandatory recycling bin, Luis pulls his phone from his pocket and sends me a payment, along with an document. “It’s a draft of my proposed paper. I’m hoping to restore hope in this topic. I’ll stop by if I ever return, but Cryo Corp needs me elsewhere from now on.”</p>
