								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Thirteen</h1><br>
<p>I slowed my car to a halt in the motor court of Megan’s house and turned off the engine. It hadn’t been the first time I’ve done so, but it was the first time in over a year, and the first time I actually knew Megan, and the first time I came without a group of friends to bring life to the party. For some, it would be the first time they saw me since George got blamed for that thing last party. For others, the first time since George passed. For others, the first time they would see me not be an absolute dead beat in a month. Which meant there were at least three different small talk routines to go through with everyone here. I didn’t want to deal with all that bullshit. I just wanted to chill and have a good time.</p>
<p>The interior car lights went dim. Moments later, headlights shined in through the back window as a car pulled up behind me. When the headlights shut off, I checked my rear-view mirror. Jenny was sitting in the driver’s seat, fixing herself up.</p>
<p>It was the first time I had seen her in a month. I thought my feelings for her were behind me. Now, I just wished they were. Simply looking at her in the mirror filled me with butterflies.</p>
<p>The bass of music permeated the atmosphere from behind the mansion, mixed with shrieks and splashes of water. Its invitation heartened me to make a move. I exited my car and slammed the door shut so she would hear me. She looked down from her mirror and met my eyes, then smiled and fumbled for the door latch. A breeze swept by as she closed the door, and it made me wonder why she bothered fixing her hair when it looked so adorable fluttered by the wind.</p>
<p>“Hey Jenny, I didn’t know you’d be here,” I lied.</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said, pulling her hair behind her ear. “I didn’t know you’d be here either.”</p>
<p>She looked to have been doing better than before I first saw her at the shop. She naturally rested a smile and had an ardent glint to her eye.</p>
<p>“How have you been holding up?” I asked, only realizing after the words had left my mouth that I did the exact thing I just complained about. Except, it felt fair, as it was genuine, which then made me feel guilty for not asking sooner. I never could win with her. Just like ‘old’ times. The thought made me smile.</p>
<p>“I think as long as I don’t dwell on it, I’m okay,” Jenny said, “So I’d rather put that behind for tonight, if that’s okay.”</p>
<p>The nuances between disconnection and compartmentalization were lost when such a night was before us. I thought were every night a night I could reconnect with a lost, regretful past, my woes would flee my mind and, in their place, would life flood once more. But for Jenny, I think it was a means of reconciliation. I hoped that my being there was part of it. No, I longed for it like I never had before, and I didn’t understand why.</p>
<p>“Sure. Why don’t we go join the others?”</p>
<p>I led Jenny along a path that traversed around the house to an open back gate. Through the gate revealed a scene of twenty to thirty high schoolers eating pizza, chugging beer, dancing with their lovers, and jumping into a pool large enough for them all.</p>
<p>I recognized almost everyone except some lower classmen, who likely were whitelisted after George, Lucas, and I weren’t. Megan caught us as she lugged herself out of the pool. She batted me a predictive smirk. On the far side, I saw Hugo and Lucas talking over a beer. Admittingly, it made me slightly uncomfortable and insecure, as it showed that it was I, not Lucas, who kept things apart.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Jenny and I waded in a small pool bubbling with steam on the far side of the yard, just slightly removed from the chaotic game of water volleyball in the larger pool before us.</p>
<p>“You know,” said Jenny, “George never told me what exactly he did.”</p>
<p>“He did something he shouldn’t have,” I replied. “One of his stories gone wrong.”</p>
<p>“Okay, but what did he do?”</p>
<p>I laid my head back and stared at the sky, contemplating what the right decision was—to tell her or not. “Don’t you think we should let the bad things die?”</p>
<p>Jenny didn’t hesitate for a moment. “I want to remember him for who he was, not who I thought he was.”</p>
<p>So virtuous of her it made me feel like Bobby trying to tame it to reality. It almost made me laugh.</p>
<p>“If you wish,” I said, still staring at the sky for it to be a blank slate for my reminisce to draw on. “George was rather drunk, and as the party died down, he suddenly decided he wanted to run from the police. And he dragged Lucas and I into it, so we could run ‘like we always do’. He said ‘it’d be a lot of fun’ and that ‘it’d always be something we would regret not doing’ had we not done it.”</p>
<p>Jenny bubbled into laughter. “How did I never hear about this?”</p>
<p>“Because they couldn’t catch us,” I remarked. “But that’s where things went wrong. Somehow it led back to the party here. Nothing really happened because the party was done by then. Yet, when we found out, George still felt the need to confess and apologize to Megan and we were never welcomed back.”</p>
<p>Jenny laughed and laughed. “Wait, when did this happen again?”</p>
<p>“This same time of year, two years ago.”</p>
<p>“Oh, George,” she said, waving water away. “You know, I’m pretty sure he got in a big fight with our dad right about that time.”</p>
<p>I sat up in curiosity. I never pictured George fighting with his parents. Especially not his dad, who was kind yet never the man you’d want to pick a bone with. “Really? About what?”</p>
<p>“He thought it was an injustice that George and I hadn’t been to Disney World, half-jokingly but also half-serious. We never really had the money to go on costly vacations outside of the casual road trip. But then it escalated into how we were just kids and didn’t understand the real world. George didn’t like that at all.”</p>
<p>No, I’m sure he wouldn’t. </p>
<p>“Do you think that’s the case with us?” I asked. “I mean, it has to be with how young we are, right? Yet, it never feels that way, because how could we not understand the world we live in? And then it’s frightening when you realize it might be true.”</p>
<p>“You know how the older you get, the more you realize no one has any idea what they’re doing? I think it’s a lot like that.”</p>
<p>“I know it all too well.” I sighed with the realization of the looming deadlines. “Day by day, I know less of what even I’m doing, let alone everyone else. I’m soon to apply to colleges with a wavering idea of what I want to do for a living, and this obscure idea is what will decide the rest of my life. It’s quite daunting.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I saw it tear you guys apart.” She took a drink of her beer and choked a little. With the face she made, I doubted she even liked it despite her persistence to get it down. “So, what do you think you want to do?”</p>
<p>“Maybe mechanical engineering. I used to want to do business because of my mom, but you know how that’s going. Then we had the joke that George was going to be the doctor, Lucas the lawyer, so I had to be the engineer, and then all this stuff with my dad…” My voice trailed as I realized I wasn’t doing a very good job keeping George out of things. “What about you?”</p>
<p>“I still have another year to decide, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“But if you had to choose right now, what would you choose?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know if I should go to college,” she said. “I have found working in the shop to be satisfying, but I don’t think it is because of the cars. I think it is because it’s not stressful. I just go in, work, and leave my thoughts at the door. So I guess I would choose a job like that.”</p>
<p>How fascinating the nuances of a life become when your heart becomes committed to it. To be with her like this was the greatest of dreams, but there was a strange weariness to it, in that the bliss was not equal to that of the movies whose adventures inspired me. How was it possible that a fake story was more real than mine? So intoxicating were those that the real world inside of them was more real than the real world itself. Not that the emotions I felt in those stories were greater—no, those were reserved for my own. But my own stories had years of monotonous context and build up. Years of mundanities that, when unchecked, spilled over into and became inseparable from the present.</p>
<p>And so was the unchecked conflict inside of me: I previously held dating George’s sister to be wrong, to tread on our brotherhood, and I valued that brotherhood above all. Latching onto her in his absence was even worse. The one girl I had grown to love now blocked by death. My relationship with her was doomed to be that of an orderly, straightedged boy.</p>
<p>But a promise was made that if I had the opportunity, I would do it. What “it” was was not important. “It” was simply the act of committing to significant choices in hopes that one would bear fruit. Yet, I was so overwhelmed by the infinitude of outcomes that actually significant choices were not being made. For every ten outcomes, eight would strike at my self-dignity. It was like playing Russian roulette, except five of the barrels were loaded with paintballs and the sixth a little candy that may or may not change my life depending on how delusional I was. But until then, each waking morning had been a game with all six barrels filled with paintballs of the nastiest of colors, and I only had so many “just one more week”s left in me. What a wasteful life that is.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. “Jenny, I—” the words clumped in my throat. I could tell a police officer to go fuck himself after climbing out the window of a home without a fear in the world, but my heart raced at the very thought of doing what I was about to do. The stakes were higher now than ever before because it was the one thing in the world my heart truly desired and it wasn’t up to me if I would get it.</p>
<p>Water lapped against the walls of the bubbling pool as she turned in my pause, but she didn’t say anything. Only stared into my eyes until mine wavered away.</p>
<p>“I was wondering if—”</p>
<p>“Hey guys!” Hugo’s voice came trampling over from across the pool. “You coming over?”</p>
<p>I ignored him and continued, “if you wanted to—”</p>
<p>“Mickey!” he called once more, as if he didn’t get the hint. I shot a glance his way, only to see him jogging over, rounding the corner of the pool. Hugo wasn’t being dull, just a dick. “We’re about to do the cake,” he said, slowing to a halt, “and we’re waiting on you.”</p>
<p>Everyone was gathered around a table doing whatever it was they were doing. I couldn’t care less. Meanwhile, another guy was walking around the pool our way. Not that I recognized the guy. He must’ve just arrived. But between him and Hugo, my proposal to Jenny would have to wait.</p>
<p>“Why a cake?” I questioned. “A cake for what?”</p>
<p>“For the occasion. To deify the fucking night, Mickey. Why not a cake?”</p>
<p>Hugo grabbed my towel and tossed it my way, then offered his hand to help Jenny up. She took it. I never hated Hugo more. A chilling breeze blanketed me with goosebumps as I raised my self from the hot water. The warmth from the sun had retreated behind the trees, leaving only the moon to light the sky. So went the last warm day of the year.</p>
<p>I wrapped the towel around my shoulders, debating whether or not to pop Hugo. Then again, I didn’t understand why he insisted on running over. I didn’t know if what he did saved me from the wrong decision. How was I to know what was right? Was I to respect George’s boundaries or respect George’s ideology? Which conflicting inner promise was I to commit to when there was no “ancient wisdom to guide me”?</p>
<p>What was true yesterday was no longer true now. Not that the truths had changed, but I understood them differently. Like one does not realize how good it is to be healthy until they are sick, or how one does not believe in ghosts until one is submerged in a dark basement, and the hairs on their arm stand straight. It is daunting to think truth was dependent on perception, but with how impossible it was to change the perception of the complacent crowd, it transformed into a means of a proof to myself that I wasn’t complacent, that I had the ability to change perspective, that the world was not doomed, and that I could do something about it.</p>
<p>When I asked myself such moral questions, I always defaulted to that which did not hurt others was indeed not morally wrong. Such was entering someone’s home without so much as trekking a spec of dirt in to their knowledge. Really, though, this wasn’t a matter of what was morally wrong, but morally right, which I came to realize was completely different, and one that I had been holding true to in my spiteful waste. That which could glue two worlds back together, or at least my world, was undoubtedly better than clenching the pieces tight. I was all in this world, so whatever I could do to fix it was worth the world itself.</p>
<p>Jenny had already headed towards the table, leaving me and Hugo behind.</p>
<p>“You just had to ruin the moment,” I bickered.</p>
<p>“The moment? I thought you weren’t close to Jenny.”</p>
<p>“What do you care? Shouldn’t you just be supportive?”</p>
<p>He nodded his head toward Jenny. I turned only to see her embracing the arms of the guy who had been making his way over. My heart twisted.</p>
<p>There never was a choice after all.</p>
<p>“Is that…”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Hugo. “In your slumber, you missed your shot.”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>	Between the cake and the drama, I stepped aside to use the bathroom. Sitting in water tended to make me have to pee, and with how much water I drank throughout the day, it was not an easy urge to control.</p>
<p>After drying my hands, I opened the door to Megan leaning against the opposite wall.</p>
<p>	“You never told me you were that close to Jenny,” she said.</p>
<p>	She reamed with jealousy. I could only guess she invited Jenny because of me, so she could play this little game and find out. </p>
<p>	I pulled her to me and kissed her. I didn’t love her. I didn’t want the spark of the heart but the rush of the moment, the tingle in my arms, and the savor of her mouth. It was impulsive and animalistic and exciting. It was my drug to pull myself out of the slump and I didn’t care of the consequences nor matter how great they may be, because I wanted nothing more than to feel alive the way that only the impulsivity of it all could bring.</p>
<p>	She pushed away and collected herself. I was tempted to pull her back.</p>
<p>	“What are you doing?” she questioned.</p>
<p>	“Why would you come in here if you knew this would happen?”</p>
<p>	She slapped me across the face. “How dare you!”</p>
<p>	I wiped the sting from my cheek, and she stomped off.</p>
<p>	“You were the one that started this.”</p>
<p>	She stopped a few feet away, then turned and walked back in a fury. “What is it that I started? Please, tell me!”</p>
<p>	I hesitated, then rose my voice to a shout. “I have felt nothing for the past month. You knew that and you came to me and you pulled me into your arms and you ki—”</p>
<p>	She palmed my mouth to silence me. “My dad is home, and everyone outside can probably hear you. Now, when I lower my hand, I want you to tell me everything, but without telling everyone else.”</p>
<p>	She was just fucking with me on purpose by then. It pissed me off even more, but I obeyed. She lowered her hand, and after a moment, I said, “You don’t seem to understand. For the last month, I felt nothing. I mean nothing. Not a hint of sadness or happiness or hunger or lust or anything. But when you embraced me that night, it was like I forgot everything. Even now…” My voice began to tremble, but I recollected myself. “I only have a few months before I move off to college. I don’t want to spend them like this. I will do anything to stop that, and if it means throwing myself at you without any sense of self dignity, then so be it.”</p>
<p>	So animalistic, so freeing. Nothing about giving into my meager existence felt wrong. It felt so right and it made me so happy to give into the irresistible nature that I used to think being irresistible made it inherently wrong. It was like I became so addicted to prying against the walls of the stream that I forgot to also enjoy the path that was already carved out by so many people doing the same.</p>
<p>	She cupped my jaw and kissed me, then shoved me back into bathroom, came in with me, and locked the door behind her.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I expected the party to be over once the chilling winds grew dominant and the sky sprinkled the patio with droplets of water and the time grew late. Most people considered it time, anyway.</p>
<p>“You have yet to do initiation,” Drake said.</p>
<p>“Initiation?” I asked. “Boy, I’ve been here longer than you.”</p>
<p>“It’s a new thing,” Megan said.</p>
<p>So the rest of us piled in two cars and drove out to a place that wasn’t far from my house. I hadn’t any idea what initiation was, but it excited me because I knew it wasn’t good.</p>
<p>Then we pulled off into a grassy area that was eerily familiar and walked onto a bridge that divided a lake and a creek via a dam. Was this a cruel prank or did they not know?</p>
<p>They led me to the middle of the bridge and told me to jump into the lake.</p>
<p>“It’s plenty deep,” Drake said over my shoulder as I looked down, “and it’s only like a forty foot drop.” Not that any of us could even see the bottom. I only knew there was water in the dark abyss below because the rain loudly lapped it in thick sheets, and because I had been down there myself once before. </p>
<p>“This seems like a bad idea,” I replied. “What if the dam opens? It tends to do that when it rains.” I knew that much because I used to run across it all the time—in sun when it was still and in rain when we could hear the water rush into the creek.</p>
<p>“Don’t be a bitch,” he said, and moments later, there I was dangling over the abyss. Heels gripping the edge of the bridge, back to the railing, fingers wrapped around the metal railing, body hanging over the side. For such a popular jumping spot, it was rather inconvenient. The warning signs didn’t help much either.</p>
<p>But I had to jump. Drake had pulled the unspoken card.</p>
<p>Hugo grabbed my shoulders aggressively, almost knocking me off balance. I gripped the railing a little harder. “You want a thrill? This is it.”</p>
<p>He was right. This was living life. Jumping into the boundless abyss. Staring it down as it swallows you up, it's death-grip around your stomach and your heart tight as you grip on to the railing even harder but then let go and leap forward anyway.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. I had a reputation to maintain. I had a life to live. I had to shed these shackles. I jumped.</p>
<p>My arms flailed in circles and my blood rushed to my head. The darkness consumed me as I fell farther from the streetlight. There was no ground for my feet and none in sight. Rain went from coalescing with the sweat on my forehead to sharing in the freefall. What was two seconds felt like ten, long enough for me to contemplate my rash decision.</p>
<p>My feet hit the water; The water consumed my body and bubbles swarmed to the surface like I had disturbed a nest of frightful butterflies. The water was cold and dark, deafening and suffocating. I was engulfed by the watery abyss.</p>
<p>But as I curled my toes against the silt, coming back to my senses, I realized it wasn’t my abyss. Overcoming my fear of heights was not what led me here nor was it why I jumped. I leaped for rejuvenated future via thrill, yet I still felt nothing wallowing in my heightened heartbeat at the bottom of the lake. The rushing of adrenaline was no more the thrill I longed for than blankly smiling was the happiness I desired. It just sucked. And somewhere in that dreadfulness my expectations turned to a mere dream of a future that never came to pass.</p>
<p>This dream hiding from the world at the bottom of the lake, too, had to end, as my lungs may have been runner’s lungs but I was no swimmer. I buoyed to the surface where half a dozen phone flashlights shone like spotlights from above.</p>
<p>“That was crazy!” Hugo called, more excited he got me to jump than I actually was jumping.</p>
<p>I waded in the water, wiping the water from my eyes like sweat during a rainy run. I wished I was running. Maybe then I could have felt more like my normal self. Back to my normal life where the worst thing that happened to me was that nothing worse happened to me. Or maybe back to the life before my parents separated. Before George died. Before Jenny left our perch in the windowsill under the warming sun. Before I jumped off of the dam.</p>
<p>Before the pounding of water on the other side of the dam caused my body to drift in the current. </p>
<p>There was no mistaking it. Everyone heard it.</p>
<p>“Swim away, Mickey!” Hugo cried with a panic in his voice, his flashlight racing down the bridge with the others.</p>
<p>So I swam, but swimming with all my might didn’t move me far enough out of the current. I was soon being drawn into it as it picked up. The longer I swam, the more I was progressively moving faster backwards in the current, closer and closer to the holes in the concrete wall. My muscles ached with pain as I pulled and pushed desperately in the moving water, like a sprint with all on the line. It was no use. There was no getting out of this abyss on my own. No thrill would save me. </p>
<p>But I still swam with an anger against the irresistible current because I fucking hated everything that tried to determine my path. It was only when nothing pushed against me, when there was nothing to brace myself against the world that I fell into my slumber; it was only when the world lulled me to sleep or beat me to submission that I would ever lose, and I at least could take a hell of a beating. I knew if I held on, the story’s great climax would come just as it always did for George.</p>
<p>A rope slung across my back; My arm wrapped around it, and it pulled my body out of the drift into still water and helped me crawl up the shore. Pebbles embedded themselves into my knees.</p>
<p>“Holy shit dude,” Hugo panted, “that could have been bad.”</p>
<p>My body fell into exhaustion as everyone gathered down at the bank. I could’ve run a marathon and still lie with more energy. I was too tired to whimper, but tears fell from my eyes disguised by the rain. This was what felt real. This was the thrill I needed. Not the necessary adrenaline of confronting my fears, but the bellowing reminder that no matter how bad I may view my life to be, I was living, and that was incomprehensibly astounding.</p>
<p>I looked at the rope still wound about my arm and in my hand. It was a jump rope. Two, actually, hastily tied together to make one long enough to reach me.</p>
<p>“I feel I must ask the obligatory question,” Hugo said to Drake, “why did you have two jump ropes in your car?”</p>
<p>“One for me, one for Grace,” he said, scratching the back of his head. “You know, when we work out.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Oh. For Grace. I see. When you work out? Right.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to thank me or patronize me?”</p>
<p>The only reason I was still here was because Drake had once met Grace, and Drake and Grace grew to like each other, and Drake carried jump ropes for Grace, and Drake happened to watch me jump, and Drake was quick on his feet. What an interesting reality I existed in, and in all the others where I had jumped but Drake hadn’t met Grace at the right time, or Drake or Grace didn’t like the other, or Drake didn’t carry jump ropes, or Drake didn’t follow us to the Lake, or Drake actually was as dumb as he looked, I was dead. The longer I survived, the less “me”s existed. Like some gameshow, and this me had passed tonight’s big, climatic round, due to no power of my own. </p>
<p>I had no idea what to do with the prize.</p>
