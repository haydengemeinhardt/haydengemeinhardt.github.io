<p>A dreadful thing happened at school.</p>
<p>The first bell had yet to be rung. Everyone moped around in the halls until then. All except one girl, who stirred a commotion where Jenny usually stood with her friends. Jenny was no where to be found, which probably meant she was going to be late. The girl, however, was Jenny’s coworker, Margaret, who just so happened instead of being nearly late herself that day arrived early enough to draw a small crowd of her friends around.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have paid any attention if I hadn’t heard Jenny’s name scolded in a scathing cry. </p>
<p>“Jenny is a bitch and a whore,” Margaret spat. “She seems nice, but she talks terrible things behind everyone’s back. She has never had any respect for anyone. Then she comes crying for attention, using her brother’s death for attention from any guy she can fuck. I don’t know why I even bothered being friends with her.”</p>
<p>Had it been a man who drug Jenny’s name through dirt, I would’ve took him outside myself. But it was Margaret, whose ex was Jenny’s semi-official boyfriend. It was only natural that drama ignited between them. I thought it best to stay out of it and let Jenny handle it herself.</p>
<p>But then I noticed Jenny standing around the corner from the drama, in a hallway that intersected the one I was in half way to the group. She had listened to every word, but instead of storming out there and settling the situation, she just stood there. Never had I imagined her just standing there. She was a Lebedev.</p>
<p>The bell rang. The group dispersed. Jenny turned back down her hallway in fret. The pain I saw in her eyes was heartbreaking.</p>
<p>I jogged around the corner to catch her, but she entered the girl’s restroom, and I found no point in sneaking in there. It was just a bad day for her, but she was strong. She could handle herself.</p>
<p>Not until after the bell rang after lunch did I see her again. </p>
<p>Hugo and I parted ways at the trashcan, and I followed the sidewalk around the building where the sun might’ve woken me up. As I rounded the corner of the building, I caught her and Lucas engaged in argument. It was a nasty and short one. Jenny threw words at Lucas that brought about the most sour of faces I had seen on him. He pushed her aside and she fell on the ground. He stormed inside the building without looking back. She cupped her face and wept.</p>
<p>It was then that I knew it was more than just a bad day for her. It was one of those days that affected all the others going forth. </p>
<p>I meant to continue walking, to sit next to her and hug her and promise everything would be alright. Why didn’t I? It was the most absurd failure of my life. I only hesitated a step, but by then, it was too late. She picked herself up and walked to the parking lot.</p>
<p>I hurried after her, down the sidewalk and between the big trees that I once sat. I lost her as she cut between cars, row by row of the vast monochrome scape. My jog turned to sprint. I dashed between rows, folding mirrors as I bashed through the gaps. How had she outrun me? Me, once of the three great track stars of the renown TRHS?</p>
<p>A car spurred alive a row back. Before I could get there, it pulled out of its spot and drove off. I only saw Jenny’s car speed down the parking lot with her front bumper sticking out of the back window.</p>
<p>A mere hesitation was all it took to watch the opportunity slip away.</p>
<p>I sighed and headed to class, figuring being late would be better than nothing. I had chemistry homework to turn in anyway. Homework for a class that I was struggling to not fail. But when I got to class, I had no desire to be there. I had only the ache to fall asleep in bed. The three hours of sleep was catching up to me.</p>
<p>I was so tired. Paying attention was hopeless. The thought of Jenny ate my mind the entire period. I could not stay at school any longer.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The doorbell rang. It didn’t echo. That was one of the things I liked about George’s house.</p>
<p>Jenny’s car was not in the driveway where it normally was. No cars were. There was no movement, noise, nor light inside the house. Peeking in the window was like looking at a painting. Still and empty.</p>
<p>The temptation itched. The itch was horrible, and wrong, but I only wanted to see George’s room one last time. My hand grasped the door handle. The itch got worse. I might have lied to myself to satisfy the desire, but there was no lying about the irredeemable act of entering their home. So my mind did the next best thing: it purged itself of the thoughts and forced my hand to open the door. Once it was open, I was so far gone that there was no point in turning back.</p>
<p>The house was stone cold and silent. I hadn’t been inside in months, yet it was as familiar as the hundreds of times I had been.</p>
<p>The living room, kitchen, dining room—they were all so familiar. So familiar that when I saw something out of place, it caught my eye. It was just a small object upon a coffee table in the living room that any other family would have cluttered with random objects, yet it was so out of place that I couldn’t help but walk up to it.</p>
<p>On the table stood an uncapped frosty whiskey decanter. Nothing else. It was a strange thing to leave lying about. The thought that Jenny drunk before school crossed my mind, which would explain the front bumper, but it just wasn’t her. I shrugged and plugged the bottle.</p>
<p>Around the fireplace were shelves ornamented with pictures. There were some family pictures, some year-book pictures, and picture-book photos that were too good to leave in a dusty binder. And there was ol’ George at the center of nearly every picture. You’d be blind to miss him. In some, he stood straight with his shoulders back, happily presenting a plaque or gold medal. In another, he ran with a white and black checkered banner around his waist and his arms high in the air as the stands stood in tumultuous cheer. So many stories George had. I was still horrendously jealous of him.</p>
<p>In that, I nearly forgot who had led me here. It wasn’t George but Jenny, who I hadn’t noticed until my eyes wandered across a family photo where her parents each buttressed her brother with her standing at the front. But she wasn’t standing at the forefront. Just the front, as she was in every picture she stood. All except one picture in which a much younger version of herself smiled as big as possible with a bronze medal. Even that picture was in the corner, where shadow covered half of the frame. It wasn’t done intentionally. Rather, without care.</p>
<p>I walked down the hallway to George’s old room and pushed open the door. His bed was made and the floor was spotless. His television and console stood upon his dresser where we’d rush to play the newest release of a videogame. His speakers stood on either side. Loudspeakers, we knew that much. We’d blast a new album and his father would come banging on the door. Lucas would rush to lock it while I held George back and Lucas would turn it up even louder. That ended when it was the cops who knocked on the door next. George even had that old deck of cards we always used to play poker with using Halloween candy. I realized that despite Lucas and I both having much larger homes with better… everything, really, we found ourselves hanging out here more than anywhere else. In that very room.</p>
<p>Upon closing the door, I noticed another room with its door swung open, despite all the other doors in the house remaining closed. It was Jenny’s room.</p>
<p>I walked to it and peered in.</p>
<p>The room was as spotless as George’s. The fan was dusted, the bed sheets were tucked in, and the trashcan was emptied, although she didn’t bother to put a new bag in. Thin curtains that draped around the window waded in a breeze from the open window. No wonder why it was colder than usual in the house. I walked into her room and closed the window. On her desk next to the window was a glass with a shallow collection of alcohol. Did she come home then go out driving drunk?</p>
<p>I decided I had been in the house long enough and didn’t want to wait around to find out. I turned back toward the door, where beside it was another door wide open, a light reflecting off of a mirror over a sink, and the sink covered in blood that dripped down onto Jenny, her back against the counter, her half closed eyes staring at me. Her legs stretched out in a pool of blood. Her wrists sliced at the vein, still leaking blood onto her pants.</p>
<p>A wave of dread plunged my heart into an abyss it did not want to explore. The tide swept step by step my trembling feet to the bloody nightmare that slowly crept itself to me. It wrapped around the soles of my shoes and drew my knees to the floor, a faint splash in the warm liquid that juxtaposed itself against the stone cold tile.</p>
<p>My heart ached. My throat grew tight. I cupped her left wrist in my hand and wrapped my other over the seam. How long had she been waiting for a last hope in life while I hesitated to help? While I sulked around school all day worried about the absurdity of life? Yet, how absurd was the life of mine to wonder if the revered thrill I lusted for was what lied before me? That I once thought witnessing the loss of life the greatest gift one could bestow upon me? I was so horrendously jealous of George that I was blind to the calamity of life that was the Lebedev family.</p>
<p>My hands were so cold that I gripped hers tighter. The warmth that I felt from hers pierced my heart with a thousand needles of fabled dreams I longed to have with her. The most obvious thing passed by me, in that she was still warm, that life had yet to flee her body, and it was only then that I realized.</p>
<p>In that moment, no sane man, no matter how nihilistic he may be, no matter how logical he may try to argue and with what little heart he may have, could truly say that her life was not worth saving, for the warm touch of her skin meant more than anything had ever meant in my life. It meant that which I would give everything of mine to preserve—all joy and happiness and thrill in life succumbed to it. That no matter how chemically or animalistically the desire may have been brought about, it existed, it drove, and it was as objective to me as my own existence. It was an undeniable truth that forever proved me wrong from then on.</p>
<p>I clawed for my phone from my pocket. I tried dialing 911 but the blood made it difficult. I typed 9 and it’d type 9 again. I wiped it off with trembling hands and 9 more numbers took its place. My hands shook so much it required focus to press a number. Then my tears fell onto the screen and fucked it up even more. I screamed as no words could express my pain.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>An officer named Velorez was the first to arrive on scene and took over my thrill from there, but I was far from rid of it. I stood shirtless in blood soaked pants and watched as vehicle after vehicle halted along the street. Finally, the ambulance arrived and a pair of paramedics rushed in with a stretcher and back out again with Jenny atop it.</p>
<p>It at least left hope; it was worlds better than a body bag.</p>
<p>I wanted to drive after her, but I was not permitted to leave, even if my car wasn’t blocked in. Instead, Officer Velorez began the questioning.</p>
<p>When Velorez asked me how I had found Jenny, I told her I saw Jenny through the window. When Velorez asked why I was outside the house, I told her I was going to check up on my friend. When Velorez asked why I had left school during school hours, I told her I left because I was feeling sick. Questions arose regarding my involvement, but they were left at that. She seemed no more interested in the answer than she was in the paperwork she filled out.</p>
<p>That’s all it was to her—paperwork. There was no story for her because it wasn’t hers. She was thrust into the midst of it, and it must’ve happened quite often. I don’t think that it was because the loss of life wasn’t significant to her, but like anything else in life, its meaning was relative to the emotion she attached to it.</p>
<p>They kept me there like a stray dog they didn’t know what to do with. A dog that went chasing after a car, caught it, didn’t know what to do with it, and was subsequently lost. </p>
<p>There was nothing for me to do, nor anything I could do. The adrenaline that had kept my eyes open soon disappeared. I sat between the roots of the front yard tree and rested my head against the trunk until I dozed off.</p>
<p>Officer Velorez shook me awake sometime later. The moon had replaced the sun and everyone was dispersing for the evening to go eat dinner with their families. So, she sent me on my way for me to do the same.</p>
<p>I drove home in silence, focusing hard to stay awake. Luckily, George didn’t live far. I pulled into my driveway a handful of minutes later and parked next to Dad’s truck, who was probably inside throwing together what he could for dinner and awaiting my arrival. But I didn’t want to talk to him about the day, no matter how much he suddenly wanted to get involved in my life. I didn’t want to answer any more questions. I just wanted to sleep. That was undeniable. </p>
<p>How sickly ironic it was for me to sneak into my own house? Only after I tossed my clothes into a trash bag was the thrill finally over. And then I was stuck with my thoughts for the rest of the night. There was no official procedure for me to follow like the police—no stretching of pompous yellow tape or tediously filling bureaucratic paperwork. Just the passing of time like waiting for the flu to move on.</p>
<p>Without a heater, I shivered in my dark room. My body felt disgusting, but the only solution was to scrub myself with numbingly cold water and I was not ready to do that quite yet. Instead I opened the curtains only let the moon dimly luminate my naked, blood-soaked body from the second story window, while the city below raced on ceaselessly as the trees shed their colored autumn leaves. It was an idyllic scene that I studied through an insomniac childhood when I was so excited for the simplest things in life that I couldn’t sleep. I just couldn’t get enough of life. </p>
<p>I’d look down at the city as a kid wondering what cool things I’d do when I got older and could actually do cool things. But the scene itself was always depraved of beauty. It was just a display of mere fact, that I was here and the city was there. I never looked at it as I do now, thinking of the people and not the buildings, for my world view was changed once more.</p>
<p>It was like showing someone a piece of art, and they’d simply acknowledge its existence and move on, but then one day they suddenly feel something when looking at the art. Maybe it was the expertise in the brushstrokes or a message that was portrayed. The art would take on meaning as emotion became like a newfound sense that sensed meaning in things. Yes, perhaps emotion was like a sense one learns to come in tune with, uniquely impossible to do without a reference.</p>
<p>What I sensed from the scene was meaning in stimulating and preserving the sense of meaning. Meaning in meaning itself. For the lone reason that I felt devoid of emotion, and thus devoid of purpose in continuing a burdensome existence. It was that understanding I felt when I knelt in front of Jenny that no sane man could deny. Yet, no sane man could say that such a thrill was worth pursuing in order to gain that realization. So it would remain that what was an undeniable truth for me would remain undeniably naïve for them. Nothing made me feel lonelier than to be on a path all alone. </p>
<p>I grabbed my guitar from its stand beside the window and slung the strap over my shoulder. As I looked down upon the city, I strummed the chords to a simple song I knew until I ran out of words in the song to sing, for I was not ready to bathe in frosty water, nor break the promise I made to myself to pursue my daily dreams, nor ignore my heart’s cry for catharsis. Only after I muttered the final words to the song was my heart exhausted and my day finished.</p>
<p>I set the guitar down and trudged to the shower. To end my day with stinging skin was only fitting. I stood beneath the shower head, took a deep breath, and twisted the handle. A small spill of icy water poured into my hair then slowed to a trickle. I looked up at the shower head in confusion and twisted the handle about, but nothing more came out. I tried the sink only to see the same. Dad’s desperation to move was worse than I had thought.</p>
<p>I sighed and went to throw on a long sleeve shirt and pants to cover my skin. It was the best I could do. Then I crawled under the sheets of my bed to finally rest.</p>
<p>For the next half hour, I twisted about beneath the sheets, side to side, too anxious, too stressed, too heartbroken, and too exhausted to fall asleep. It is in such times that one begins to notice the minute details of their reality that at first would require a genius to find, like pieces of the room that were once invisible but once keen vision glanced over, it was so obvious that it became a mystery how it wasn’t noticed in the past. </p>
<p>Yet, instead of untangling patterns in the ceiling, my eyes rested upon my backpack of unfinished work on my chair and the clock that stood upon my desk ticking my life away and the cup of coffee beside it with its hearted i. To anyone else, it was peace alas, but to an ardent individual who yearned for adventure, finding comfort in bed hardly after the sun had set was to deny them of the greatest bounties of life. It was to stare blankly at a view after pushing the boulder up the hill for the day, to sit in a chair and embrace the most mediocre of lifestyles instead of devising a means of no longer needing to push the boulder day by day, nor make the day’s trek meaningful, nor, in my case, discover how either of those two things were possible. </p>
<p>I sprung out of bed and chugged the old cup of coffee. Then I slung my backpack over my shoulder and plodded down the stairs, through the door, and across the grass and sat beneath the streetlight between my neighbor’s yard and mine.</p>
<p>It is much easier to pull oneself out of bed when a deadline is to be met. I had a month to decipher my heart’s reasoning to attend Valencia and to twist it into an exaggerated life story.</p>
<p>I pulled out the notebook that I hadn’t opened since the day in the world’s worst café, when Lucas, George, and I were making fun of our terrible drafts that read like satire. Oh, it was so bad. “But when I ran or read or strummed the guitar, I never felt the same joy I felt when sparks of my own realizations reinvigorated my life to explore the mystery of life and understand where it came from.” I never really told anyone that I actually wanted to go for a history degree. Looking back on it now, it was quite laughable. The month had helped me realize that, but it wasn’t what I needed. I was hoping that whatever I was doing would mold itself into some grand, last-minute life story to explain the degree path. Instead, it only made me question going to college in the first place. It was “the spark of my own realization” when I opened that notebook, thinking I could distract my thoughts by writing them down.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of staring at empty pages, I replaced the notebook with unfinished chemistry homework. Only, half of the questions were unsolvable, and the other half were so long that my mind kept wandering off before I finished comprehending the question. How was I to focus on frivolous work when such bigger questions danced like demons around my head? I quite simply did not care. I fisted the paper with both hands and tore it apart. I tore that homework until the shreds were thin enough to flutter away in the wind. The shreds spread about and hid themselves amongst the leaves. I grabbed my backpack and headed inside.</p>
<p>As I climbed the porch steps, Dad shuffled out the front door. He carried a box in his arm, wrapped in green paper dotted with candy canes, scarfed penguins, and jolly gingerbread men. Balanced atop were two envelopes and a smaller package that held them down.</p>
<p>“You’re a hard man to find,” he said, holding the door open for Flint to mosey on out. The door swung shut as Flint ambled down the steps and took his position sprawled out in the lawn, and Dad handed me the box with both arms outstretched. “Happy birthday, Mickey.”</p>
<p>The calendar indeed read November 2nd. The thought made me laugh. It hadn’t been a very good birthday, but I hardly cared about the day to begin with, so there was no reason to mope about it. “Dad, you didn’t have to—”</p>
<p>“Of course I did.”</p>
<p>“What about the bills?” I asked, not expecting any gifts other than maybe a warm shower. A shower alone would have sufficed, as did the coffee, for unbeknownst to him, I stood drenched in Jenny’s blood under my clothes.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve raised you all wrong, haven’t I?” He sat on the top porch step and set the box next to him. “My paycheck is just coming in a little late. But that’s not for you to worry about. I suppose you have enough to worry about as is.”</p>
<p>I sat on the porch step with the box between us and took the smaller package. A shipping label covered its face with my name and address. I peeled apart the tape that sealed it shut and on opening it, I found a Gillette razor.</p>
<p>“Ah, right,” Dad said. “That’s one of two things every eighteen year old boy is guaranteed on their birthday.”</p>
<p>“What’s the other thing?”</p>
<p>He motioned to the envelope that laid next in the stack. I ran my fingers along the seam and withdrew a card required my registration to the selective service by the end of the month.</p>
<p>“Lovely,” I said.</p>
<p>“Indeed,” he replied, “but now that the formalities are over, I hope the next gifts are ones you enjoy.”</p>
<p>He said so because the next envelope had my name scribbled on it in his handwriting. It wasn’t as eloquent as Jenny’s, and there was no fancy play on the i, but it wasn’t often that I received anything of the sort from him; he wasn’t the sentimental type. He had changed, though. I could tell.</p>
<p>Dear Mickey,</p>
<p>I am far more proud of you than any father has the right to be. </p>
<p>You are 18 now. If your life has not started yet, it does from this day forward. You have a long life ahead but remember as long as you don’t let time escape you, the rest of the century will be yours to accomplish all that you’ve ever wanted to accomplish.</p>
<p>I’ve watched you run for years. I know you can catch your dreams. Just make sure you chase the right ones. And if you lose your grip on the mountain you choose to climb, that is okay. I will always be here to catch you.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Dad.</p>
<p>It was the best piece of paper I held in my hands in a very long time.</p>
<p>I gently set the envelope beneath the package at my side so that it wouldn’t fly away into the leaves and be sloppily retrieved by Flint—as good of intentions as he might have. Then I pulled the green box into my lap. It was heavier than I expected. The wrapping paper was easy to claw through, and the flaps of the box neatly folded to their sides.</p>
<p>Inside were two smaller boxes. The smallest was in the shape of a cube. It was split horizontally in the middle with a spine that folded at the back as I pulled it open. It housed a watch that was wrapped around a little pillow, with a white face and an aluminum case and a black strap. I never owned a watch before. I never needed the utility with a phone in my pocket that did just fine. But I realized it was for more than to tell time. It was the one piece of jewelry that men could wear, and this watch would fit any outfit I owned.</p>
<p>The larger of the two boxes was a shoebox that held more than just a new pair of running shoes, but a new pair of running shorts and socks and waterproof earbuds. All the gear except my phone that I used to run. I began to wonder if the bills weren’t paid because of a late check, or if he splurged more than he should have on birthday gifts. Regardless, I felt as spoiled as a boy could be.</p>
<p>I set the shoebox beside the watch, note, draft card, and razor and peered in at what remained. An old Nintendo 64 lied at the bottom, with its price tag still stickered on, along with two controllers and an assortment of games.</p>
<p>“The newer consoles were a little expensive,” Dad said, “but this little sucker was the peak of my life for a good while.” He fished out a red cartridge from the box and waved it between two fingers like a business card. “I haven’t seen this game in ages.”</p>
<p>“It seems like you wanted it more for yourself than for me,” I joked.</p>
<p>“Well, I would love to try it out with you,” he said, “but you boys are always looking to try new things, and what better to try than classics that stood the test of time?”</p>
<p>By “you boys”, I knew he only meant Lucas and I. That was who the second controller was for. Yet, Lucas was farther removed from my life than George. I might’ve had more luck getting Jenny to come over… after, or if, she recovered.</p>
<p>The tears flowed forth from the dam I built. I embraced my father before they fell, burrowing my face in his cotton jacket. The box fell from my lap and hurdled down the stairs, followed by a loud crack. I tried to look, but Dad pulled me in.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it,” he said. “You have enough to worry about.”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>There was a family that I knew of who always got home late at night on Mondays. Not for at least another hour. Soccer practice, church, night at the Grand Plaza—whatever it was, the house was empty on Mondays when I would pass it on my way home from George’s house that time of night. I never bothered to explore it because I could tell it was bland from afar, although enough caffeine cycled through my veins to make the adventure a thrill on its own.</p>
<p>I was not headed for an adventure, as much as the perpetual lust tugged. It was wrong to kill, but not to kill for self-defense, and it was wrong to steal or trespass, but not wrong to steal or trespass for self-preservation. That night I did not need a thrill to persevere. I needed a hot shower. I was going to lose my fucking mind if I could not get a hot shower.</p>
<p>My first intention was not to enter the house. I tried going to a couple of people’s doors, asking kindly for permission, but the prospect of someone taking a shower in their house was too much, I guess. They closed the door on me each time. I expected it, but it made me wonder why. It would be a simple act of kindness that wouldn’t impede their life at all. Then I remembered that I had failed to do the same for Jenny, of whom was a dear friend, so I had not the right to speak.</p>
<p>I parked my car down the street in between two yards so neither house knew if it was for their neighbor, then walked down the sidewalk under the moonlight with my gym bag on my shoulder.</p>
<p>A car drove by. I thought nothing of it. A woman walker her dog opposite of me. I waved as I passed her. A couple of kids played in a yard across the street. I walked up the driveway and tried the front door. The handle didn’t budge. I hopped the fence and tried the backdoor. It opened.</p>
<p>I found my way to the master bathroom and locked its door, then shed myself of my clothes and set the shower to its highest heat. As soon as I saw steam rise, I jumped underneath.</p>
<p>It was orgasmic, the type of euphoria one feels shamelessly running back to a please after detoxing themselves and wondering why they ever tried to stop. I grabbed my soap and sponge from my gym bag and scrubbed the stains from my skin. The water ran red down the drain. I scrubbed my body three times and washed my hair twice. Then I checked my watch set on a high shelf in the shower. 45 minutes until I should have left. Oh, how quickly that time would pass.</p>
<p>I stopped the shower, filled the adjacent bath with warm water, turned on music from my phone, and lowered myself into the water so low that the music muffled and only my face floated above the surface. </p>
<p>What happened then was perhaps the most frightening experience of my life. It is that which happens when one detaches themselves from the world for a moment that feels like a lifetime and lies staring into space so deeply that they forget they are there at all. </p>
<p>I thought back to a time when I complimented George on how disciplined he was to be so good at running. He replied that he was perhaps the least disciplined person he knew. He thought he hadn’t done anything in his life he didn’t want to do. It wasn’t that he hated running as I had, but loved it.</p>
<p>At the time, I thought nothing of it. Then college applications came about, and I was forced to create a life story for myself. I thought I understood what he meant, but lying in that water, having come from the stories I asked for, I realized I had it all backwards—it wasn’t stories that made him excited, it was his excitement that grew his desire to do things that became stories. Stories were just a byproduct. The question wasn’t how does one get stories, the question was how does one become excited for life?</p>
<p>The simple rephrasing of the question ruined everything. I was right back to the beginning of knowing nothing, and twice as lost.</p>
<p>But it was more than that. I thought I found meaning in playing along with the universe’s game to understand itself. I thought that the reason of consciousness was to escape being an animal. What else would the purpose of it be, after all, if not to pull away from the complacent lifestyle of an ape? No boundary of life seemed greater to push than that.</p>
<p>Yet, George showed that consciousness was the most animalistic thing possible, for it was furthest down the path of evolution. I had gotten the two mixed up, only to realize it was because they are the same. It wasn’t about escaping being an animal at all. It was to say that there was no objective difference between complacency and adventure, for both were animalistic inclinations. With that, the entire idea of a meaningful existence collapsed. All purpose I had was stripped and there was no hint that I’d ever find a new, truthful meaning. </p>
<p>My heart raced and shrunk. The abyss stared deep. I did not flail about in the water, nor sob in despair. My heart was too empty. The thought was too unbearable. Somewhere, I grew so fatigued from the adrenaline and so lost in thought that the music faded, the world grew dark, and I fell asleep.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The door crashed open and slammed against the wall. I sprang to my feet as though the crack of a gun began a sprint. Water splashed across the floor. </p>
<p>“Freeze!”</p>
<p>My eyes darted at the door. Two officers blocked it with their guns drawn. It was the only way out. There was no running. </p>
<p>“Hands behind your head,” said one of the officers. I recognized the voice, and when we made eye contact, I recognized her and she recognized me. It was Velorez.</p>
<p>I broke eye contact and looked around the bathroom. There was a frosted window, but it would be impossible to break in time. I thought about charging past them, but with their guns drawn, it was a death wish. Behind me was a closet.</p>
<p>“Don’t make this harder than it has to be, Mickey,” she said. “Just put your hands behind your head and turn around.”</p>
<p>I dashed to the closet and slammed the door shut behind me. I flipped the light switch. There was no lock. I hoped there would be, and that I could pound a hole through the drywall, but I had to hold the door shut.</p>
<p>I braced my back against it and dug my feet into the floor, ready for them to ram into the door. Nothing came. I only heard her say something to her partner, although I couldn’t make out the words. Then her steps creaked nearer toward the door, slowly but steadily, and stopped on the other side. </p>
<p>“Listen to me carefully,” she said, “I understand that you are in great pain, but right now, you have to come out. If not, things will only get worse.”</p>
<p>How could things possibly get worse? I had no home, no friends, no more future, no more desire for a future even if there was one. My life was forfeit. There was but one thing I clung onto, one thrill left I had in mind, and that was to make my stand against the world to the very end.</p>
<p>“I can help you, but you must come out.”</p>
<p>“All I wanted was a shower,” I sobbed.</p>
<p>There was a pause before her reply, in between my sobs. She waited for me to continue, but I had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>It is never until the extreme situations that one knows what they truly believe. I could not explain what I believed in the moment, for it was so suddenly realized, but while being in a home was adventurous, and while it might not have been wrong if I was never caught, it was not noble. It was not to be a man. It was to desperately chase the first inkling of an adventure without any idea of what it really meant.</p>
<p>George would never have done such a thing; I knew that much. But had he, and had he been stuck like me, he would have faced the consequences head on. I thought the catch was he never got stuck like me, with society up in arms—which was true—but there were always consequences, just different kinds. That’s what made danger, and danger is what made it an adventure and not just a journey.</p>
<p>My thoughts might have been different if I thought I could escape. Had the cops not known my name, I would have been pounding into the drywall. But the danger of the adventure caught up to me, and I had to live up to it. My only wish was that it was along a better path.</p>
