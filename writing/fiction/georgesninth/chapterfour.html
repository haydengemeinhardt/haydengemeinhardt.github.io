								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Four</h1><br>
<p>George said the day I could outrun him on our route would be the day he would be fine with me talking to Jenny. I never could tell if he was joking; I had a crush on Jenny once in fifth grade and he and Lucas never let it go. Today I took him up on that offer.</p>
<p>When I run I picture an army</p>
<p>Gone awry behind enemy lines</p>
<p>I’m pulling injured crew to safety</p>
<p>Under siege by a depraved enemy</p>
<p>I picture a stadium up in cheers</p>
<p>An opponent racing up from the rear</p>
<p>A gold medal on a pedestal</p>
<p>A finish line drawing near</p>
<p>A princess in a tower</p>
<p>A wolf on the hunt</p>
<p>A shooter in a school</p>
<p>A thief on the run</p>
<p>When I run, I picture stories</p>
<p>Seldom insipid, habitually melodramatic</p>
<p>For if one is born with an imagination</p>
<p>Why not make life polychromatic?</p>
<p>Rounding the final stop sign–one marked by its blinding reflection of the sun in its polished state; one that promptly replaced the old sign drunkenly bent into the dirt after a thou-shall-not-be-named executive’s party with too much champagne–my house came into view where Lucas sat on its porch with a folded newspaper in one hand and tea in the other, talking to my mother as casually as one could sweaty, breathless, and shirtless.</p>
<p>Running was an integral aspect of his life, as much as a morning coffee is to those who find no other motivation to get out of bed. What difference there was between it and succumbing to other human instincts Lucas so often criticized wasn’t one he could establish beyond the mental accomplishment. And even then, the dopamine rush was not disparate to any other dopamine rush.</p>
<p>But he would still imbue it with visceral music and embrace a state of mind that brought out the emancipating dreams we all dream, to experience them with the pains and joys of it all together. It was his journey in life that no one else could comprehend, all its ups and downs a part of a story separate from reality; in that, no one cared, because no one truly appreciated embracing an aspect of life such as that. People with the gift of a human mind, antithetically devoid of the discipline or desire for dramatizing physical and mental struggles in life beyond what they had yet to overcome.</p>
<p>That much we had in common.</p>
<p>My foot crunched the bits of gathered gravel at the curb, collectively carried by years of rain and wind and worn soles slowing to a halt at the foot of the driveway, and Lucas snapped the newspaper open as though he were attentively buried in the day’s selected drama. It wasn’t until Mom welcomed me home that Lucas lowered the paper and said, “oh, about time.”</p>
<p>I leaned my arms against the post, panting. “You have a very poor sense of humor.”</p>
<p>Mom backhanded my arm. "Highly critical of your friend today are you? </p>
<p>I glanced at Lucas who raised his eyebrows and pulled back up the paper. I hoped whoever wanted to read it had done so by now as sweat trickled from Lucas’s hair onto the pages. His whole show was a mockery of me.</p>
<p>"He wasn’t an easy kid to raise,” Mom said, turning back to Lucas to tell yet another story from my childhood for the thousandth time, knowing she had already told it but loved Lucas’s laugh. No one else cared for the stories that entrenched her for years. “He was scared of any doctor, dentist, or anything that came with an appointment not because he was scared of the procedure but because the wait times were dreadfully long and behind schedule. And he would complain and complain until he got home, and then complain about everything else. Dinner was horrible, showers were a waste of time, bed time was too early.” Lucas returned all the pleasantry gestures as the story carried on, nodding and shaking his head in beat with her tone. “It has gradually built into a perpetual state of grumpiness, always letting the bad things ruin the good things. Always griping about any minor inconvenience...”</p>
<p>“I’m honest,” I blurted, my breath recovered after her dragged out story. As a kid, my time might not have been as valuable as it gets with age, but it was precious to me. That much was lost with age.</p>
<p>“Honest to a fault,” she replied, taking one last sip of the tea before rising. “No one wants to have minds read to them. Especially not at your age.”</p>
<p>“I know where I get it from now.”</p>
<p>“Where’s George?” Lucas asked. The pages of the newspaper crunched as he slammed it onto the table. “Wasn’t he with you?”</p>
<p>“I went ahead of him at the bridge. He had started to slow down.”</p>
<p>Lucas immediately stood and hopped down the stairs. “I’m going back for him. We shouldn’t have split.”</p>
<p>Not when we needed each other the most. I knew Lucas wanted to say that, but us guys aren’t known for our soft sides. Had it been during a run, maybe.</p>
<p>Still though, leaving George behind like that? Trying to smoke him when life was already doing that for me? Imagine what had been going through his mind, watching Lucas and I breeze past him when he used to be the best of the three; the two guys he trusted most leaving him behind as he failed to keep up with everything around him.</p>
<p>We jogged around the stop sign and caught sight of George running not far down the street. Less than a half mile from the house. We closed the distance fast, heading towards each other, then Lucas and I turned around and jogged next to him.</p>
<p>“Push yourself,” Lucas yelled. “This is what life is about. Pushing through the pain when all has gone to hell and still coming out on top. You only get to live this day once, so don’t live it in failure. You sprint to the fucking end of it no matter what.”</p>
<p>George grunted and broke into the sprint. He sprinted so fast, Lucas and I couldn’t keep up, even after our break. That was the George we knew. The runner of the group. He was the one with the discipline to do what he needed to push himself. Him falling behind was a sight to behold, because it never happened before. </p>
<p>There was a reason he challenged me to a race. It wasn’t a joke. He wanted to beat me like he had always done in the past–he wouldn’t have made the bet otherwise. And I wouldn't have felt bad leaving him in the dust if I didn't think he'd swing back around me in the final stretch. Something was wrong, but he sprinted faster than I had seen him sprint in a long time then collapsed in the grass of my front lawn.</p>
<p>“There’s the George I know,” Lucas said, panting after catching up with him. “What was with the slow down?”</p>
<p>“Oh… you know… saw a cat… and tried to… chase after it,” George said between breaths.</p>
<p>"What, did you not eat lunch?" I asked.</p>
<p>George ignored me and crawled over to the outdoor water socket, drenching his head and drinking water. </p>
<p>"So you just ran 8 miles on an empty tank?” Lucas questioned. “You're crazy."</p>
<p>"Mom just got transferred last night," George said, the water still pouring down his back where he sat. "It was the last time I was going to see her before her procedure in two weeks, or less than that, I don't know. But me and Jenny were up with her all night saying our goodbyes. Just in case, you know.</p>
<p>Lucas sat down beside him. "Shit, man, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>George cracked a smile. "The doctor said he had high hopes. He said he wouldn't say that if he didn't believe it."</p>
<p>"You said two weeks?"</p>
<p>"Something like that. They have to do screenings and monitoring and they're taking her early, just in case." He shut off the water and stood up. He looked no less wet than before when he was drenched in sweat, but the way the water rolled over his abs showed that he was losing weight.</p>
<p>"You should really be there with her," I said, grabbing his shoulder.</p>
<p>"The plane tickets and hotel fees are too expensive, plus I need to work."</p>
<p>"Hell, I'll cover the tickets and hotel myself."</p>
<p>George shook his head. "I have to get through this on my own. I can't slow down and wait for you to run back and encourage me every time things get hard. I have to get to the finish line on my own. It sucks not being able to see her, but I know I wouldn't live with myself knowing I sat back while you two carried me. That's not going to help me move on if things don't go well and it's not going to leave a good taste in my mouth otherwise."</p>
<p>The whole family was stubborn, of course. George, his sister, and his father. Even his mother was too stubborn to die.</p>
<p>"If you care about it that much,” Lucas pleaded, “just say you'll pay me back. With interest." </p>
<p>We all knew Lucas wouldn't take the repayment anymore than George would accept the offer. George ignored him.</p>
<p>"Fuck dude just please let us help you."</p>
<p>"I am. I promise.”</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>There is a window sill in my house that overlooks the street and down into the city. It sits in the guest bedroom and is only ever used on nights I can’t sleep. I leaned my back against its wall and stretched my legs out in the alcove.</p>
<p>I tried texting George an hour ago but got no response. I could only assume he had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Instead, I scrolled down in my contact list and clicked on Jenny. I’ve had her number since one time George forgot his phone at home during a track meet and Jenny was dragged out there to support her brother, so I contacted him through her. I never texted her personally, though.</p>
<p>Hey Jenny. George told me the news about last night. Hope you’re doing well.</p>
<p>I set the phone down and continued staring out the window. I wasn’t expecting a response.</p>
<p>A minute later, my phone vibrated.</p>
<p>Did George not pick up the phone?</p>
<p>Still in an attitude, but still wanting to talk to me and I was okay with that. I know George is okay, I talked to him during the run. I don’t know if you’re okay.</p>
<p>I’m fine. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p>Well that was a lie. It was one in the morning and we had work tomorrow at seven thirty, and she had stayed up late the night before with George.</p>
<p>When I said I respected you earlier today for pushing through your problems, I really meant that. But you can also be sad. I’d be worried if you weren’t.</p>
<p>We’ve known this day would come for years. We’re all holding up better than you think.</p>
<p>Maybe they really were fine. All this time I had been convinced George was suppressing things, but maybe he already came to terms with it.</p>
<p>Then what are you depressed about? Why do you walk into the shop depressed and stay up past midnight?</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p>That surprised me. She could simply pin it on her mom and wallow in her misery. Why didn’t she?</p>
<p>I would find out one day. But for tonight, I simply sent her the start of a tic-tac-toe game. An X in the bottom left corner. Along with a text: How did you come to work at the shop?</p>
<p>She sent back an O in the opposite corner. I took my car there a week ago and got swept up in a conversation with your dad about everything. Then he talked to Mr. Martin and offered me the job.</p>
<p>So he had known. And he was helping. All while I was yelling at him for not doing anything. I sent back an X in the top left with no accompanying text.</p>
<p>Jenny put an O on the left middle square. I really like your dad.</p>
<p>I placed the X in the bottom right spot to finish the trap. I do too.</p>
<p>She sent an O in the middle and I struck the finishing blow in the bottom middle. I liked that she had finished the game. Most people usually quit by then.</p>
<p>Now that I won, I get to ask you another question</p>
<p>I’m not sure that’s how that works</p>
<p>Well it is. How does a car enthusiast not know how to drive a manual?</p>
<p>She sent me a game for pool. I don’t really care for cars actually. Mine just forced me to learn.</p>
<p>Then what do you care for?</p>
<p>No more questions. You have to win first. Your rules.</p>
<p>I personally never cared for pool. Jenny had sunk the eightball before I got through a quarter of my striped ones.</p>
<p>Do you actually like cars?</p>
<p>Only because I was forced to be good with them. And I don’t have much else going on in my life other than running.</p>
<p>An hour later, the clock struck two and Jenny sent me a picture of her smiling and holding up a peace sign. See you tomorrow.</p>
<p>I had not seen her genuinely smile before. Not like that. It wasn’t an ear-to-ear grin. It was just a slight one that couldn’t be helped but to express itself.</p>
