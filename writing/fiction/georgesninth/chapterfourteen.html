<p>How could I forget?</p>
<p>“Remember, test on Monday,” Mrs. Rupert had told us last Friday as we shuffled out of the classroom.</p>
<p>I, in fact, did not remember, and I was certainly not ready to take the test that was laid in front of me.</p>
<p>Lucas sat at a desk cater-cornered to mine, zipping through the pages and circling answers like he was checking obvious boxes on the paperwork in the doctor’s office. Chest pain? No. Trouble breathing? No. Family history of diabetes? No. One would have thought he had invented the chemical nomenclature himself.</p>
<p>He left the party early, probably to get some last minute studying in as I should’ve done. As I planned. But how could one expect themselves to bargain away a beautiful moment of life so they could maintain the monotonous success of the future? One shouldn’t. It is inhumane. </p>
<p>I answered what questions I could but still had half of the test unfinished. Best case scenario: another D plus; a rejection from Valencia; a life of regret and catch up. Maybe my mistake in English wouldn’t end things alone, but paired with this, I was fucked.</p>
<p>I had to cheat.</p>
<p>It went against all the virtue I stood for. I knew it was wrong. And not only that, but Mrs. Rupert was strolling around the room, stopping at the front, glaring over everyone, hunting for a cheater, sniffing them out.</p>
<p>Then again, whether I got caught or not, I would likely fail. So the question was: could I seriously sit here and let my life slip away for such a small misstep so I could hold onto a tenuous meaning of virtue, when a solution rests in my pocket? It’s the way it should be, after all. I had got nothing but perfect grades for years through dedication. I took notes and paid attention in class. I did all of the homework. And after all, who hadn’t cheated at some point in their life?</p>
<p>So this was where the line was. Where I abandoned virtue for comfort. So be it. My care for the future was too deeply enrooted beneath my values and I hadn’t hours to deliberate it. Time was ticking down fast, and to cheat discretely would take time. This whole virtue thing was screaming complacency anyway. That was a thought for a later time.</p>
<p>I slid the phone from my pocket and set it on the chair between my thighs. I started from the shortest questions, those easiest to type with one finger as to not look suspicious. It was hard without looking. Sometimes my thigh would be in the way or I’d hit the wrong button and autocorrect would be beyond confused. I couldn’t go any faster, though, not without risking being caught. So I kept pushing through—typing away when Mrs. Rupert’s back was turned and then writing the answer when she turned back.</p>
<p>After about thirty minutes, I had gotten through a chunk of the test. Enough to get me to a comfortable C. I could have stopped. I should have. But it was so thrilling. It was one thing to cheat when you would get away with it, to enter a home when no one is there to catch you. This was something else.</p>
<p>I checked the clock behind me, beneath of which Mrs. Rupert stood. I only had ten questions left, and five minutes to do them. Not terrible, but not the A I should have got. My heart raced against time. One question down, two down, then three. Four minutes left. A fourth and a fifth that was a bitch to type. Three minutes. A sixth. A seventh. Then an arm reached over my shoulder and grabbed my test.</p>
<p>“Time’s up,” called Mrs. Rupert, and the entire class watched as she folded my test and tossed it in the trash, the plastic bag crackling to the weight.</p>
<p>Lucas looked over his shoulder, saw my empty desk, and furrowed his brows in unfeigned confusion, as in ‘why did Mrs. Rupert toss your test?’ because me cheating was apparently too hard to believe. Stare in awe, oh Lucas, and maybe you will see what I see.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>“Do you think cheating is fair?” Fritz asked as he twisted the blinds closed.</p>
<p>I did not know how to respond. I had never been caught like this before, and I couldn’t simply outrun Fritz. Well, I could, I suppose. The problem would keep up. It was that which I needed to outrun. Unfortunately, the race was over. I had lost. I felt nothing like I thought I would feel. I just felt nothing.</p>
<p>“No sir,” I replied, “I do not.”</p>
<p>“Do you think fairness is important?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir, I do.”</p>
<p>“Then explain to me,” he said, leaning against his desk, “Why did you cheat?”</p>
<p>I could lie and deny I had done anything at all. Abandon virtue for comfort. I very well might have if I thought it would clear my name. But I knew better. The whole conversation would be predictably formulaic. I knew everything he would say, and he knew everything I should respond with. What I wondered was, would he have anything to say that was worth either of our times? Or was my being in his office just a formality, or a test of my honesty?</p>
<p>“Because I forgot to study,” I answered, “and otherwise I would have failed.”</p>
<p>“Well, not only have you failed, but you have landed yourself in academic dishonesty.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Fritz, I have always studied and always made good grades on everything my entire life. I have never done anything wrong like this. This last time was just a fluke and I learned my lesson. I promise it won’t happen again.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter how capable you are of getting an A,” Fritz said, “It matters if you applied yourself and learned the material, of which you clearly did not. The only lesson it seems you learned is how not to get caught cheating, and all I bet you are wondering about now is how to not let cheating bar you from your top college.”</p>
<p>For the length of his monologue, I tried maintaining my eye contact, but I just couldn’t with the onset of watery eyes. The realization was setting in that I was fucked and whatever consequence that came my way was out of my hands.</p>
<p>I wish I could understand that Valencia would not impact my life. Really, though, I didn’t know if it would or wouldn’t. I could only guess, and my guess was that it would. It was a genuine enough guess that I couldn’t pretend it away. And I cared about my life enough that the goal within that guess was defining my perception of myself. </p>
<p>Fritz sighed and sat into his big, leather chair across his giant oak desk, behind his pruned nameplate and his pseudo gifts from students. Maybe if I drew him some art, he could flaunt it as him helping the sad kid and he’d fuck off. “I understand that George’s death has taken a toll on you, but that does not excuse this behavior.”</p>
<p>“No, I understand that.”</p>
<p>“Still, we have resources to help you. You don’t need to go through this alone.”</p>
<p>Fritz and the whole lot of them were so blind to me by this point that who I was on the outside was still apparently the old me I was trying to shed. I had yet to</p>
<p>It was so much more than George at this point. Yet everyone was quick to jump to that and slap the label on me because there was no other explanation that they knew of. At the same time, their perceived use of George as an excuse grew old, and so did everyone’s acceptance of it. None of my other reasons were valid anymore either. Split family, lost friends, and bad grades? Show me someone who hasn’t dealt with it. Yet, here I was, the only one whining about it, like Hugo said. What a fucking loser I was.</p>
<p>How was I to explain that the more I opened my eyes to the world, the more I was losing myself in it? To admit such a thing is psychotic.</p>
<p>It wasn’t counseling I needed. I didn’t need someone to tell me that I should use kinder language with myself and take long, gratuitous walks on the beach when stressed. I needed someone to tell me the answers to my questions until there were no more answers and then give me time and a break from life to work from there.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Fritz let me go without marking my record. Not out of sympathy. He didn’t want any imperfections on the school’s record. He wasn’t one to walk around with a rulebook tucked under his arm. I can’t say I wasn’t relieved.</p>
<p>Rumor had it that no one was ever expelled for fighting or other misdemeanors, they were just added as candidates for the bussing program. Luckily it was too late into my senior year for that, but I still wasn’t going to rid my transcript of the F the devil on my shoulder had lassoed in.</p>
<p>Through the glass door of the front office, I could see Lucas leaning against the wall with his foot kicked against it, looking at the ground until he perked up and made eye contact. He had a look of disappointment and was waiting for the door to open to let me know of it. </p>
<p>“Cheating? Really?” he said, kicking off the wall and joining me on my pace down the hall to the next period we were already late for. “The test wasn’t even that hard.”</p>
<p>I hesitated to reply. Neither of us had really talked in over a month. The awkward tension lingered like bad body odor. But it was past time we spoke, and I couldn’t ignore him.</p>
<p>I stopped and turned to him. “I was going to fail, so what was I supposed to do?” I questioned, throwing my arms in the air. “Turn in a half blank test and delete my applications?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know, study?” Between Fritz’s admonishment and the sarcasm in Lucas’s voice, I was ready to punch something. He simply prepared for it and continued regardless, “It would have been better than spending the night jumping off an open dam drunk because Drake of all people dared you.” He pulled out his phone and flashed me Drake’s post: a video of five drunk teenagers hyping a sixth to stumble off a ledge in the middle of the night. “Honestly, I don’t know which is more stupid. Ruining your future or trying to get yourself killed.”</p>
<p>“The fuck do you care?”</p>
<p>Lucas shook his head and waited for me to continue, but I said nothing more. The ensuing silence demanded his response.</p>
<p>“Look, I love you to death,” he said, “and you know this. But you never go out. You don’t run anymore. I tried to hang out with you and you stayed in. I tried to talk to you and you spaced out. I invited you out and you left me on read. There is only so much I could do, and it got to the point I stopped bothering.”</p>
<p>I knew I was in the wrong. It’s all I ever seemed to be in. Bobby was right: I could tout beliefs night and day but living up to them would be truly difficult, no matter how much I believed my own words. They were so fragile and fickle, especially when they changed so suddenly and regularly and depended so much upon the ponderings of others.</p>
<p>But I didn’t need Lucas to rub it in. “I’m sorry, was there something you wanted to tell me? Or are you just here to bicker?”</p>
<p>“I miss you, dude. We were like brothers for years.” His voice began breaking. “At some point, I had to take care of myself, okay? I was hardly able to drag myself along. But I’m better now and I don’t want to lose you too.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember that day when we were running with George, except we had left him stumbling behind despite the state we knew him to be in? And we said never again? I would have never left you behind, even if I had to drag you to the finish line myself. That’s what friends do, that’s what teammates do, that’s what brothers do. But that’s not what you did.”</p>
<p>I resumed my walk down the hall, except I wasn’t going to class anymore. I was going home.</p>
<p>“So that’s it?” Lucas called. “You’re just going to leave everything we had behind?”</p>
<p>It was so easy to do just that. I was not mad at him; I was mad at everything about myself that I would have to explain and all the wrongs I would have to admit. The new commitment to life that I was poorly following, that awfully strange-when-taken-out-of-context question: What would George do? </p>
<p>Damn it, damn it, damn it.</p>
<p>Who was I? In but a moment, I lost myself. Like I didn’t know myself. Oh, but I did. I felt emotion and latched onto it. I saw an excuse to be upset and pursued it. The two things a part of me wanted more than anything, and I let that part of me take over. It was in the absurd case that I realized who I truly was, and who I was was someone who loved misery. Such an animalistic desire. Who was to say that wasn’t the same me driving everything else? That all this living like George bullshit wasn’t just me looking for misery or any other animalistic desire? Because the most miserable, loving thing was what I was about to do, what George would have done.</p>
<p>I twisted about in my tracks, ready to hug him and apologize. But he was gone.</p>
<p>All in a moment, it was gone. As quick to pass as if I was talking to myself the entire time, and the whole thing phased out like a bad dream. It felt no more real, after all, but so much more terrible and heartbreaking, to think that I actually hurt Lucas like that.</p>
<p>I pushed through the exit doors, where the sky was still blanketed by gray clouds gently raining. The path to the parking lot was covered only so far before one would have to resort to umbrellas or, in my case, zipping between the coverage of the oak trees. But I stopped at the base of the first tree, tossed my backpack to the side, and slumped down to the ground in an open patch between the roots. I rested my back against the trunk, propped my arms on my knees, and watched the rain stretch as far as I could see. The downfall drowned out all other noise than its beating against the ground and the leaves of the branches above. A rhythmic sputter of drops fell from the foliage and wet my hair and my arms and legs as the chilly breeze carried the musky smell of wet soil. </p>
<p>We used to love the rain. George, Lucas, and I. Long ago, we ran our first 5k in hundred degree heat. Then we ran our first 10k in rain. Our first 20k in light snow. The worse the weather, the better, because it added an extra layer of mud for us to push through. It was mother nature daring us; we always hit our milestones when dared.</p>
<p>Of course, Mom would get pissed when she found us running up the street in the rain or snow or heat. It was always “You’ll get pneumonia” or “You’ll get a heatstroke”, and then we’d be barred from running again the next day, but that was always fine because we were too sore then anyway. We’d just put on the whole “oh, come on!” act and then go take long showers and celebrate that night.</p>
<p>Those were the good, innocent times that I missed but was glad were passed. The world just didn’t turn fast enough for us back then, and for me to still be who I was and in the same situation would be disappointing. That’s why, for fleeting moments in time, I was glad George died, because nothing else would have been as big of a wake up call as that. </p>
<p>It was just too big of a wake up at once.  It wasn’t the gentle eye-opener of the sun shining through the curtains on a Saturday morning. It was the fire alarm screaming that my whole life was on fire and I had just been sleeping away while time smoldered my aspirations turned to ash. I was so paralyzed by the sight that I ceased to act, so that instead of blindly living a life, I was wallowing in it as it passed by. That wasn’t any better and it was enough to scare me back to sleep.</p>
<p>Then Hugo came along and smacked me upside the head and told me to move my ass. So I did, but everywhere I moved, the fire followed. No matter what scope I tried to change, no matter what philosophy I adopted, there was always a fatal counter or problem. That which brought meaning did not make them any more or less true than the others. Most demanded complacency, and that was something I was not ready to give back into. I would strip the world bare before I was forced to accept that. </p>
<p>My understanding of the world was provisional and proven wrong with every day and every realization. What good was denying complacency if it only made my life worse? All the while a fear was ever looming, that if I didn’t know myself to the greatest extent, then in what would feel like a mere blink, I could succumb to the very worst part of myself and ruin everything. As I had just done, adding fuel to the flame.</p>
<p>I can understand, now, why everyone strove for complacency. No one really had a better answer. The most peaceful and prosperous lives were those of accepting such a fact. To deny it was childish. But to envy it never for a moment seemed right. The very least that I could perceive to be true was that a grand life, if nothing else, would satisfy me. That is what George opened my eyes to, and now that I’ve seen it, it was self-evident.</p>
<p>Time and time again I return to these thoughts. What changed in between them? Or, rather, what stayed the same? Those same animalistic thoughts were. The ones I criticized so harshly for being inherent.</p>
<p>Wet soil squished to my side, where Megan walked beside me. “Mind if I join you?” she asked, the rain dripping on her too.</p>
<p>“Are you skipping class too?”</p>
<p>She sat into the dirt next to me. “I was looking at the rain through the window, and then I saw you sit under this tree, and thought why sit in the classroom and watch the rain if I wasn’t paying attention anyway?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m assuming it’s much nicer inside.”</p>
<p>“Warmer, yes,” she said, stuffing her hands beneath her arms, “but I don’t get to smell the wet soil or hear the rain beat against the leaves.”</p>
<p>It was such a small statement, and probably a lie too, but its contents did not miss me.</p>
<p>“Sorry about the other day,” she said, “about the dam and all. We’ve been there many times and the dam was never open.”</p>
<p>“Don’t feel bad,” I replied. “I knew it would open. I live right by it. I don’t know why I still jumped... But I’m so glad I got to have that experience.”</p>
<p>I was glad for so many things to have come my way, despite the tempest my heart was thrust into. What a life it would have been otherwise, with no gale to wash me upon these shores. Would it not be right of me to convince others to venture along the same path? To even so much as lead them to events when words alone would never sway, like Megan had done so time and time again?</p>
<p>“You two!” a raspy voice called from behind us where the sidewalk was covered. “Get out of the rain!”</p>
<p>The fuck did she care so much that she had to take the inconvenience out of her day to yell at us?</p>
<p>“Why?” I yelled back.</p>
<p>“Because I said so!”</p>
<p>“I’m literally going to be running track in the rain in a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk back to me!”</p>
<p>This was ridiculous. I was damn near eighteen—an age that made me uncomfortable with how serious it started sounding—and I could still be bossed around like a child.</p>
<p>I lowered my voice back down and said to Megan, “You made me do something insane. Now, can I ask the same of you?”</p>
<p>With the nod of her head, I stood and lowered my hand to help her up. I shouted back at the teacher, “We were just leaving anyway!”</p>
<p>The teacher seemed content with the answer, until she realized I meant I was leaving to the parking lot. “Come back, or you’ll be sitting in detention!”</p>
<p>Like hell I was. Had it not been raining, she might have run out and grabbed us herself, but the discomfort of the rain was enough to separate us from her.</p>
<p>Megan whispered to me, “you call this insane?”</p>
<p>“No,” I replied, leading Megan to my car, “She might be, but this isn’t what I meant.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>----</p>
<p></p>
<p>The neighborhood was familiar. Even in the rain, chatting away with Megan in the passenger’s seat, I knew where to go. It was along one of the many paths we used to run along, so after years of pacing down it around this same time of day, I knew who would be out, which houses parked their cars out front or in the garage or regularly left their lights on, and which ones remained empty until later. </p>
<p>You don’t notice these things when driving by faster than you can take note. You aren’t really even there at all. You’re in the car, with a top over your head, an air conditioner blowing on you, and music drowning out the noise. Each house and car and tree look as one would see a face in a strange crowd. But to me, they were like looking at a crowd of familiar faces, like how one looks at a class photo of people they don’t really know, but just see walking the halls every day.</p>
<p>I didn’t know the people, however, or it would make this whole ordeal a lot weirder and more complicated. Not like I knew Megan who smiled at me from the passenger’s seat. </p>
<p>“You seriously didn’t drive to school today?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t like driving in the rain,” she replied, “and with the traffic leaving school, the bus ride is sometimes faster anyway. And I get to hang out with friends, instead of being an old hermit like you.” She poked me in the arm.</p>
<p>“I’m not a hermit,” I said, laughing. “You’ve known me for a little more than a month. Give me benefit of the doubt.”</p>
<p>“Why should I do that?”</p>
<p>“Because I want to open up to you, and see if you see what I see.”</p>
<p>I slowed the car and pulled it onto the curb to park.</p>
<p>“Is this your house?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No,” I replied, twisting the key and shutting the car off.</p>
<p>“Whose house is it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but we’re going to a different house around the corner.”</p>
<p>She furrowed her brows in confusion. “Then why are we parking here?”</p>
<p>“Just follow me,” I said, stepping out of the car.</p>
<p>The rain lightened to such a gentle sprinkle that there was no getting wetter than the dampness that our clothes already held. I led Megan down the street, around the corner, and up an empty driveway of what I tentatively knew to be a consequently empty home, assuming my last visit here went unnoticed. I rang the doorbell and waited for no response.</p>
<p>“Do you know these people?” Megan asked. She stuffed her hands between her arms in the breeze.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then what are we doing? Selling girl scout cookies? In this weather?”</p>
<p>“Not quite,” I said. I wrapped my fingers around the door knob and twisted it open. “I asked if you wanted to do something crazy, so here it is.”</p>
<p>She faltered back a step. Her face twisted with a slow realization. In each passing moment, with every small reflex she had, my idea seemed to grow more awful.</p>
<p>“This isn’t what I thought you meant,” she said. “This is illegal, and wrong, and weird.”</p>
<p>Her stark hesitation struck me. If anyone would do this, other than me, it would be her. I realized how nonchalant I became about something that but a few weeks ago would make me feel the same way Megan felt. In fact, it still did. I still knew it to be wrong. But just because it wasn’t just, doesn’t mean it wasn’t justified in my own worldview. Everyone does things that they know are wrong but justify and reason it away, because the world and our thoughts are too complicated to be simplified to such commandments. I was doing this for Megan. Her wellbeing was put above an unchecked respecting of someone else’s privacy. They would simply have to, unknowingly, live with it.</p>
<p>“We are just going in and out real quick,” I said. “Is it wrong if it affects no one?”</p>
<p>“It affects me. I don’t agree with it.”</p>
<p>“If it affects only yourself, then let yourself be affected and see what happened.”</p>
<p>“It goes down to my very core not to do this.”</p>
<p>“You think me jumping off that bridge didn’t affect me to my very core? Yet was it not for that that I became a much better person?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see how this would make me a better person.”</p>
<p>“Let me show you.”</p>
<p>The rain picked back up to a downfall, like a barrier that entrapped us, and the wind swept it under the roof, darkening the concrete near our feet. Perhaps the world was on Megan’s side, nudging her towards a story she would otherwise not pursue. I outstretched my hand with one foot stepped into the doorway, where warmth crept from the empty house. Megan looked up and down the street, then reluctantly took it. She took mine gently and with pull, so that I would have to grasp hers and make the decision for her. I pulled her inside and shut the door behind her. Then I took off my coat and shoes as one would their own home and motioned for her to do the same. She wasn’t so eager.</p>
<p>“You are way too comfortable,” she scoffed.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to leave wet shoe prints.”</p>
<p>“Wet shoes prints?” </p>
<p>“Yes, it’ll dirty the floor.”</p>
<p>“You break into someone’s house, and you worry about wet shoe prints?” </p>
<p>“I would not be doing this,” I said, “If I wasn’t wholly convinced this wouldn’t affect anyone but myself.”</p>
<p>She folded her arms and looked to the floor. With that, her posture lightened. She seemed to realize it wasn’t as spontaneous and dangerous as she thought, that I knew what I was doing. Yet I knew that who she thought I was and the me that stood before her were now two separate entities. </p>
<p>It made me uncomfortable. Knowing that was who I was. I was never someone who had malicious intent; I was just someone who wanted to distract myself from my own pain by pursuit of some ridiculous thrill. A thrill like this was only done because the respect that was expected of society, of people like me, by these people was not reflected back. I was like a child that did not respect his mother because his mother did not give anything in return, while everyone else just saw me as a child with a bad attitude. And there something more that I just couldn’t put my finger on, because the feelings that lingered were not only those that I knew by name.</p>
<p>I had no qualms calling myself a child, however. I felt to be a child with how less of the world I understood day by day. I didn’t even understand my own actions in that regard. The only thing I understood was that this would likely be the last time I’d ever do something like this, because what I thought I’d get out of it was not what I was really getting. </p>
<p>Everyone seemed to be right and me wrong. But that was just the thing—everyone was clearly wrong about something, for otherwise this world would be a righteous place. Just what was it that was wrong? And how wrong are we? How monumentally consequential is our wrongness?</p>
<p>“How do you know there aren’t cameras or security systems?” Megan asked, looking about the room.</p>
<p>“Do you see any cameras or hear any alarms?” I returned. “Those aren’t things you hide. Now please, don’t be rude. Take off your shoes.”</p>
<p>“We’re well past that stage, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Megan, please just take me seriously for a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“Tell me what we’re doing here first.”</p>
<p>“I will, but first take your shoes off.”</p>
<p>She stepped on the heel of one shoe, slid her foot out, and kicked the shoe aside. Then she did the other shoe and threw her arms in the air. “There.”</p>
<p>I shook my head and turned back to the room that stood before us. “Now, tell me, what do you see?”</p>
<p>“I see a living room.”</p>
<p>“Be more specific.”</p>
<p>“This is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Just do it.”</p>
<p>“Okay, fine,” she said. “I see high ceilings. A couch pushed against a wall. A coffee table that separates the couch from another chair, a television that’s placed too high on the wall above a fireplace that sits in the corner. Some plants sit on a windowsill. And a rug in the middle of the room with a cluttered table on top of it.”</p>
<p>Her drawn response was as though she too were a child, who was thrust into an uncomfortable situation and used mockery to deflect. At least she was listening.</p>
<p>I led her through the living room and to the kitchen, then asked, “What do you see here?”</p>
<p>“Counters lining the wall, and cabinets above” she said, and sarcastically rattled on once again.</p>
<p>Then I led her down a hallway to the master bedroom.</p>
<p>“What do you see here?”</p>
<p>“A bed, Mickey. I see a fucking bed,” she said, and while laconic, it was exactly right. There was literally just a bed and a dresser and a television. “Now get to your point. Why are we here?”</p>
<p>She was pissed well beyond what I ever expected. Did I just become this nonchalant about it, or did I do something else? I shrugged the thought because I was past the point of return, and because I was uncomfortable standing in the bedroom. I walked her back out to the living room and slumped into the chair that was next to the couch. “Don’t you see how bland and predictable this house is?”</p>
<p>She awkwardly stood in the middle of the room, one step towards the door. “I guess.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t any effort,” I said, gesturing to the bare walls and empty space. “Nothing to make the place they call home unique beyond the utility they fill it with. There’s nothing that says anything special about these people, other than that they watch television and eat food and sleep. And because it seems like this could be anyone’s house, it means that most people live lives like this. Just work and television and sleep.”</p>
<p>“This shouldn’t be news to you,” she replied, with a look of confusion as though I said the most obvious thing. It was obvious, but the new connection into our everchanging web of bearings in the world had yet to be made like it was for me.</p>
<p>“It’s not. Yet somehow, the obvious suddenly became unobvious. These lives were meaningful and precious, and they still are, but they are so depressingly uneventful that it makes me wonder why a life that is as meaningful and precious as I thought it to be seems to only be wanted when it is comfortable. As though the value of their mediocre life is bound by animalistic instinct.”</p>
<p>“So what? Maybe they are happy with this life.”</p>
<p>I sat up in my chair, eager to finally explain my point. “Why be happy with life when you can be excited for it like a child who can’t seem to get enough of it? Why spend all of your time watching television when so many dreams are but ten minutes a day away, like learning a language or an instrument or how to draw? Why not spend your days becoming the best, most interesting person you can be?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s hard,” she blurted without a second thought, “and life is already hard enough as is. People just want to be happy, and if they find happiness in being able to relax and watch their favorite shows and spend time with their family, who are you to say otherwise?”</p>
<p>“How is it being hard an excuse when this life is all we will ever have? Is our all in in life really this?” </p>
<p>“I don’t feel the need to go all in when I’m perfectly happy the way I am.”</p>
<p>The quick, instinctual responses were the same responses I expected out of everyone. They even jumped around in my own thoughts. The pain that was required to become interesting seemed meaningless in the end with no utility in life. But when I thought of running, I knew I absolutely hated running. I didn’t like it at all. It was painful to the greatest degree and tortured my persistence. Yet, as painful as it was, I loved it and never wanted to let it go.</p>
<p>“I think that’s where people are wrong. People do everything they can to maximize their happiness and minimize their pain. I wish we would stop trying so hard to like life and instead learn to love it. To find value in activities that stimulate our existence than those that simply make our existence bearable.”</p>
<p>A silence from Megan’s side of the room unnerved me. It pulled to it my eyes that were wandering across the ceiling as I spoke. As I looked to her, she frowned and turned to the door.</p>
<p>“Wait, what’s wrong?” I asked.</p>
<p>She began shuffling her shoes on. “I expected better of you.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s like you look at everyone like dumb ants.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true at all,” I replied.</p>
<p>“You literally brought me into someone’s house to tell me how blind and stupid they are. Is that how you see me? Just someone you talk to to satisfy yourself?”</p>
<p>I did not know how to respond. I would a reply had it been about the house, but this was about her. I hadn’t the faintest idea what I did to convince her I was using her when she was someone I cared enough about to actively indulge my thoughts in.</p>
<p>“I think you misunderstand me,” I said.</p>
<p>“No, I think I understand just fine,” she retorted, reaching for the door. “I’ve dealt with a hundred guys just like you, who all think they’re special, that the world revolves around them, that think they figured everything out that no one else has. You’re no different, and I naively thought you were.”</p>
<p>The sound of rain amplified with the door’s opening, and the muffled pour ensured when she slammed it shut behind her.</p>
<p>I lunged from the chair and tied my shoes on as fast as I could. By the time I got outside, Megan was already walking down the sidewalk in the opposite direction of my car. I would have walked alongside her, but it was not a light rain. Instead, I sprinted around the corner to the car. The breeze from the sprint chilled my bones. I had left the jacket in the house. It was too late to go back though; My relationship with Megan was worth more than the jacket.</p>
<p>I got into the car and started up the engine without care of how much water I drenched the seat in. I sped around the corner and caught up with Megan before she got far. She was still soaked.</p>
<p>“Get in the car!” I yelled as I pulled aside her, slowing to a walking speed.</p>
<p>She ignored me and continued trudging through the torrent.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, okay?” I said, but she refused to stop. “I was trying to open up. Convince me I’m wrong.”</p>
<p>She kept walking. Apology, confession, acknowledgement—nothing was working.</p>
<p>“You live miles from here. Let me at least drive you home. I won’t say a word.”</p>
<p>She stopped, thought for a moment, then pulled the door open. Her soaked clothes squished against the leather as she slammed the door shut. “Not a word.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t happy about ignoring the tension between us, but it at least got her in the car.</p>
