<p>Just as every other Sunday, I found myself sitting in the passenger’s seat of Bobby’s truck crossing the river that split the city whole.</p>
</p>I spent the week without Megan wanting to speak a word to me. Who knows if she told anyone about what we did. I never heard anything about it, so I can only assume she was kind enough to keep quiet. I would have asked Hugo, but he was out sick for the first half of the week, and somehow stretched it out through Friday.</p>
</p>In hindsight, it was such a bad, bad idea. It wasn’t a story for her. It was me telling her one. She never dreamt of the magical house, so it didn’t matter what I said or how much I tried. She needed the same experience I had to even understand what a story meant to me.</p>
</p>How paradoxical it is to think that people need stories to understand that they should pursue stories, and that no amount of anything else will ever change their mind. With such a paradox plaguing my philosophy, it was impossible to tell if I was wrong. My only means were to get others to persuade me otherwise.</p>
</p>“Bobby,” I asked, “do you want to live forever?”</p>
</p>He groaned and rubbed his temple. “No, I don’t want to live forever.”</p>
</p>“But you don’t want to die, right?”</p>
</p>“Are we doing this again?” he asked, sternly in that it was less of a question.</p>
</p>“Just entertain me for the car ride there,” I pleaded, “then I won’t talk about it for the rest of the day.”</p>
</p>“Fine, but answer me this one question. Have you been doing any drugs?”</p>
</p>I laughed. “What? No.”</p>
</p>“I’m serious, Mickey. I’m not here to demean you. I only want to help you. So please, be honest, are you doing any drugs?”</p>
</p>“No, I have not done any drugs.”</p>
</p>He nodded. “Alright. Good. It’s best you—especially you—don’t. But with the questions you ask, I hope you understand that you worry me.”</p>
</p>“Well don’t tempt me,” I said, “because if that’s the case, I just might go buy an ounce. Best we prescribe the whole world—”</p>
</p>Bobby caught my arm as I swung it about an imaginary Earth in front of me. “Boy, I won’t hesitate to beat your ass if you ever come in my truck smelling like that.”</p>
</p>“I wouldn’t doubt it,” I replied. But I wasn’t necessarily kidding, because if it meant people would start asking questions and looking for answers, I’d believe it was worth the whole world going through a twelve step program in it. Although, I knew better, because the stoners at school were only better at asking questions. No one seemed to care about looking for answers. Asking the question was enough, much like bragging about a resolution was enough to get the reassurance without having to actually going through with it.</p>
</p>“Now, to answer your question,” he said, “No. I do not want to die. But why do you ask?”</p>
</p>I formed a finger-gun and pointed it at Bobby. “Good, then you’ll do as I say and answer my questions.” </p>
</p>He didn’t find it amusing. Not even a slight smile. I shrugged and holstered my gun. “From all that I’ve heard,” I continued, “it seems that I’m the only one that wants to live forever. But no one wants to die, and I don’t see the difference.”</p>
</p>“If you would never die, you would remove the factor of excitement from life.”</p>
</p>The way he said it, as if I hadn’t thought about that, irked me.</p>
</p>“I don’t think most people have that to begin with,” I said. “I think most people live as though they don’t give death the gravity it deserves because they don’t unconditionally love life. They live according to the most fundamental function of living—to rid themselves of pain. That is what keeps us alive and that is all life on Earth cares about. But the very nature of life is pain, as pain is meant to prevent death. When the essence of life is to sustain itself and not die, how does it make sense to have no longing to live forever, to not want to die? Isn’t that the most natural of things?”</p>
</p>“Why do you care?” Bobby asked, his head propped against his arm that rested on the window. Behind him, the supports of the bridge flickered by in sequence.</p>
</p>“Why don’t you care? I mean, it seems to me that not caring is where the problem arises from. I don’t think people truly don’t want to live forever. I think that they don’t give these thoughts the time of day. And what that tells me then is that their world view is wrong.”</p>
</p>“How can you declare it is wrong when you yourself said it is impossible to objectify these things?”</p>
</p>“Because it is a contradiction, and I at least know contradictions are wrong.”</p>
</p>Bobby kept driving, down the slope of the bridge and into the other side of Newport. His lack of a response either said he didn’t have an answer or he didn’t care enough to think of one.</p>
</p>“If you don’t care,” I questioned, “then do you at least care of the arguments of ethics? Surely it is of the utmost importance to you that you do what is right, as if obvious by our trip out here.”</p>
</p>“It is indeed.”</p>
</p>“Then let me propose this. Do you think that ethics determine your worldview, or that your worldview determines your ethics?”</p>
</p>“I’m not sure they are connected like that.”</p>
</p>“I find that when my worldview changes, so do my ethics. That if I ever wanted to convince someone of a difference ethical viewpoint, I would need to change their worldview first.”</p>
</p>“How do you suppose that?”</p>
</p>“Well, your worldview is your understanding and your beliefs of reality. I could never persuade you of an ethic that does not reasonably fit according to that comprehension because it would not logically make sense. Similarly, it does not logically make sense to not follow an ethic that fits within your worldview—and I don’t mean ethics that you believe in but ones you actually follow. It’s like our ethics are formed naturally by what is most right according to our worldview. Thus, if we are to care about ethics, we really are to care about our worldview. And I’m saying your worldview has that stark contradiction you don’t seem to care about, and it is contradictory in and of itself to care about ethics, as you do, but not about that contradiction.”</p>
</p>“Let me suppose I care for the moment, then,” he said. “Your derivation regarding living forever depended on the notion that staying alive is the most natural of things. Yet it is you who touts to not live like an animal, to not always fall prey to that which comes naturally. That itself is contradictory, don’t you think?”</p>
</p>No words came to my mind as thought typically does when it has an answer. </p>
</p>I could keep arguing about worldview, but I merely argued that to get him to care, and he gave me the care I asked for. Another answer could easily be to begin arguing semantics until the meaning of the statement was lost, but I wasn’t trying to change his mind on that subject either. I brought up the argument for myself alone, so Bobby could persuade me otherwise, and so he was doing. There was no purpose in debating the meanings of the words, because the meaning that the words had were enough to sway my thought, and it was the swaying of the thought that I had to address.</p>
</p>As deeply and honestly as I could reach into myself, I found that I wanted to live forever. I wanted to decide when I would die instead of nature deciding for me. Yet, so much of my thought was based upon not living as lazily an animal would. To not give into complacency. The entire reasoning behind my motivation to pursue an understanding of life was founded in that refusal to follow the natural urge of complacent.</p>
</p>I slumped my head back into the seat. I was wrong once again.  I wasn’t sure exactly what I was wrong about, but I feared it was my reasoning against complacency, not my desire to live forever. Yet without that reasoning, I ironically felt no desire to live forever, for I then had no argument against being complacent with life, and I would have no love left for life to be able to endure the pain it presently brought me because I did not love complacency.</p>
</p>“Do you know why you know why I insist you come with me every Sunday?” Bobby asked, interrupting my thought.</p>
</p>“You said because you needed help.”</p>
</p>“I’ve been doing this longer than you’ve been alive,” he said. “You are a mighty help, but that isn’t why I had you come along. In fact, it wasn’t really my decision.”</p>
</p>I sat back up in my seat, setting aside my dilemma for a later time. “What do you mean?”</p>
</p>“Your father was the one that suggested you come along.”</p>
</p>“It was my dad?”</p>
</p>He nodded. “Yep. And it wasn’t to get you away from Jenny.”</p>
</p>My cheeks flustered. Not because I was embarrassed by Bobby suggesting that. Rather, the thought of Jenny and I being together excited me, yet the moral to not pursue George’s sister barred me from ever contemplating that thought. “We’re not a thing.”</p>
</p>“I don’t care either way. But it wasn’t because of anything like that. Although I wouldn’t be surprised if it was to see what the world was like for those without the gift of wealth.”</p>
</p>He threw those final words in to poke at me. I wasn’t sure if he was serious. My mind was too conflated to care. I felt undermined and insulted by my own father. I felt that I disappointed him. I felt to be a failure in not realizing, and angry that I was perceived to be spoiled.</p>
</p>“Why would he want me to ride along with you?” I questioned.</p>
</p>“He told me about what you were doing. Why you took up the job. And the conversation you two had that led to the job.”</p>
</p>The conversation? About me asking them to help George’s family? Was he fucking kidding me? Did my dad think I was spoiled because I thought it right for them to use their excess of money to help save my best friend’s mother?</p>
</p>Bobby did not need to entertain me the rest of the ride. I was in my own head, scattered by thoughts.</p>
</p></p>
</p>--</p>
</p>I was glad Dad didn’t go to work that day. He didn’t go most Sundays, but that Sunday in particular I didn’t feel like riding home with him, and was glad to be alone with my thoughts for the drive. I wasn’t mad; I was ashamed. Thoughts rushed through my mind,<i> was I not a good enough son to keep Mom in the family? If they didn’t think I was spoiled, might they have listened and considered helping George? Was I actually spoiled and irreversibly removed from ever understanding the true pain of the world? Was being spoiled the root of my apparently childish notions about how one should live life? </i>The worst part was that if I was spoiled, I did not see how, which left me questioning what other awful aspects of myself I was blind to that people were just too kind to point out.</p>
</p>The only thing people weren’t shy to left me know about was my driving skill. Not only were the thoughts spacing me out, but drowsiness made me lazy, and the sun blinded me from the horizon—the one thing I hated most about the changing of seasons other than the passing of time. I was lucky to make it home without adding onto my workload at the shop.</p>
</p>I pulled into an empty driveway, which meant Dad was out doing dad things. It was a good excuse to postpone my confrontation, yet I was stuck with my thoughts till then. I stepped out of the car and felt the cold weather sweep in for the night, reminiscent of the front that finally passed. It was perfect running weather, and while I was not consistent with my running anymore, the world’s tug could not be ignored. I greeted Flint as I entered the house, then made my way to my room. I tossed my keys on my bed, changed into a pair of shorts, stripped my shirt, tied my running shoes, and jogged out the door.</p>
</p>The rust was immediately apparent in my lungs and legs. Each mile was almost a full minute slower than before, despite such perfect weather. I could still outrun any cop that come my way—the thought passed my mind when I ran past the house that I took Megan to, where my jacket was left. The impulsivity to sneak in and get it back—or even audaciously ask for it back—knocked around in my mind, but Megan’s mighty disapproval made me uneasy, and probably for the best. So I kept running.</p>
</p>I passed by all of the other houses I had entered throughout the month, along similar streets. The apparent blandness of their lives nauseated me: always out working, always stressed, living each day as though happiness would soon appear, and never striving to own a home interesting enough on its own to invite people over—not that I was invited to begin with. I could not believe I had been on track for such a life all but a month ago. I ran on.</p>
</p>I also passed by the new home of my mother, who seemed to move onto a new life as well. I had refused to contact her since. Maybe that was something I had an obligation to do as a son, and same for her as a mother. And with no one else to contact at the moment, I strongly considered knocking on that door again just to see how we would both react. To see how my morals truly were in that situation, and not just what I thought them to be. But I kept running.</p>
</p>Lastly, I crossed the bridge where I last saw my friend George, taking a glance at the lake over the railing. I wanted to make the jump again, just to experience that bliss at the bottom of the water and the disoriented crawl ashore. Instead I ran onwards, not stopping to dwell. My mile time was bad enough as is.</p>
</p>The streetlights flickered and the sky darkened by the time I arrived home. Dad’s truck was parked in the driveway and the living room lights shone through the window. Flint barked as I approached the door and greeted me when I opened it as if he hadn’t seen me all day.</p>
</p>“Had a good run?” Dad called over the sizzling of dinner.</p>
</p>“Yes sir,” I yelled back, and rushed up the stairs to shower.</p>
</p>I struggled to wash my body while my legs burned and begged to be given a rest. But I didn’t want to leave the shower. It was yet another escape from my life where water drowned me in warmth and silenced the world. So I positioned the shower head appropriately and slumped onto the tiled floor with my back laid against the wall.</p>
</p>Under the hot water, I questioned myself and who I was. I felt stripped of the lucidity of my past life. I thought myself to be a terrible person for the things that I had done to the ones I loved. I never once treated George as a friend should have when tough times beset him, and instead grew fixated on his sister, who even she I couldn’t keep happy and instead grew envious of those who did. I besieged Lucas and left our friendship behind, only regretting after it was too late as all do who screw up. I pissed Megan off and convinced her I was using her for my own good, which I guess I was. Hugo didn’t even seem to be all that present recently even with consideration of his illness, and the more I thought, the more I was convinced Megan told him. Her words echoed in my mind about how I thought everyone was dumb ants. Hell, I’ve been breaking into people’s houses and constantly belittling others in my mind. And not only am I a thief, but a liar and a cheater too.</p>
</p>The room went dark. The motor of the steam vent fan died. The only light was that of the fading sunset trickling in through the frosted glass window, and the only noise that of the falling water. Then the water grew cold. Very cold. Much colder than I usually refreshed myself with at the end of a steamy shower. I sat still regardless until my body cooled. Then I decided to wait longer, until my body was shivering. Then I waited one more minute before turning the water off.</p>
</p>I dried and dressed myself in the dark. Downstairs, the front door opened and slammed shut, but no truck sputtered down the driveway. I grabbed my phone to use as a flashlight and wobbled to the living room, peering out the window only to see my dad perched on the porch steps with a beer in his hand and Flint at his side. The streetlights still lit the road and our neighbors’ homes looked lively behind their curtains.</p>
</p>I pushed open the door to join him. “Hey Dad.”</p>
</p>“Oh, hey Mickey. Dinner’s on the table.”</p>
</p>“Got it done right before the outage?” I asked.</p>
</p>“With time to spare.”</p>
</p>I sat onto the stairs next to him. I knew what I had to ask, but instead I decided to just enjoy the moment with him first. To simply enjoy mere existence comfortably for the moment I could. But oh the very catch about it was to simply enjoy it was like eating candy—to only eat candy was to live a horrible life. As one does on a hike, overlooking a beauty scape, I picked up my stick and continued my journey.</p>
</p>“Dad, do you think I am spoiled?”</p>
</p>He tilted his head quizzically. “What makes you think that?”</p>
</p>“Well, Bobby said you had me go along with him in part because of our conversation about George’s mother.”</p>
</p>“And he said I thought you were spoiled?”</p>
</p>“No, not exactly. I rather inferred it.”</p>
</p>“That’s not at all why,” he replied, sipping his beer. “It was not some form of punishment or lesson. You’re too old for that stuff and you’re only getting older. I mean, only a couple more days and you’ll be eighteen. An adult. A man.” He slapped me on the back and grasped my shoulder. </p>
</p>“A man?” I laughed. “I’m still a boy, really.”</p>
</p>“The understanding will come. To be a man means a lot of things that aren’t expressible until you are compelled to be one. But to be a person of worth is far more important, and one you teach yourself if you’re lucky enough. And the most important piece of advice I can give you in accomplishing that goal is to never let time escape you. It will pass, but don’t let it sneak by. Don’t be the guy that wonders where five or ten years went, because then you’ll be a lot older yet in no better of a position to do anything about it.” He took a much longer sip of beer.</p>
</p>Me and him were on the same page there, but he said it less as an intended piece of advice and more of a confession that I supposed had something to do with the power outage behind us. That question—the obvious one he expected—would come, but I had more important things to worry about. I cared much more about knowing who I was than I did about the power, or traffic or potholes or weather.</p>
</p>“Why did you want me to go, then? With Bobby?”</p>
</p>“Right. Well, it indeed was about our conversation at dinner that night. But the reason I asked Bobby to take you along was because I knew Bobby did his Sunday thing and it seemed you wanted to help people, so it only made sense. I never considered you’d say no, so I never thought to ask you first. I’m sorry about that,” he said. Then after a moment, he added, “You can stop if you want.”</p>
</p>“I actually quite enjoy it,” I replied. It wasn’t until I became spiteful that I stopped letting joy in. “I still am doing car stuff and getting paid and all that. And Bobby is really insightful, you know?”</p>
</p>Dad laughed. “Word has it that you’ve been driving him up a wall. Won’t be too much longer before you’ll be stuck back at the shop on Sundays.”</p>
</p>“I’ve started to realize.”</p>
</p>Before silence could ensue, Dad broached another topic. “I’ve been meaning to ask you something. How would you feel about moving?”</p>
</p>I took a deep breath. “Why are you asking that?”</p>
</p>“I know I promised to not move until after you graduated, but that was before…” he didn’t need to finish his sentence. “We don’t need a house in such an expensive area. I know we’ve owned it forever, but the sale would more than pay for your college. And you can still finish your year at Roosevelt.”</p>
</p>I hesitated to answer, not knowing if saying no was of the most spoiled things I could do.</p>
</p>“Everyday,” he continued, “I wake up to a house missing a piece of itself. We could move away and start fresh,” he took a sip of his beer, “and move on with life, you know?”</p>
</p>“I don’t suppose it’s up to me, is it?”</p>
</p>“I won’t do anything until you’re comfortable with an answer.”</p>
</p>I didn’t have an answer, so nothing was done. Instead, he grabbed two more beers, and we enjoyed them on the porch together before he headed inside for the night.</p>
