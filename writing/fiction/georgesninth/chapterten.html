<p>The urge called for my sixth adventure into another unknown home before heading to my own that night: A place to compartmentalize my thoughts, a place to “do something” about my conflict, and a place to fulfill the thrill.</p>
<p>How I lusted for the thrill of seeing police even try to catch me running through backyards and over fences, across streets and into woods. “Catch me if you can, oh masters, and I will submit.” I never feared it because I knew not a cop in the city could catch me. Yet, I’ve only ever dreamt of it, as not once has anyone ever called the police for anything I’ve stolen because nothing I’ve stolen was ever worth calling the police for.</p>
<p>No one will hunt someone down over a missing stick of gum, nor over the concomitant sticking of it under their desk when they’re not looking. Not that I’ve done the latter—there’s no thrill in some callow declaration of individualism, to say “I’m not going to follow your rules but bend them and watch you pull your hair out at the thought”. And I think that’s what makes it all the much better, like stealing an apple from a billionaire. You get half the thrill of a real heist and all of the thrill of getting away with it and doing it again the next day. And the next day. And so on to the heart’s content.</p>
<p>I really did try. I mean, I tried to find a billionaire to steal an apple from. But if I had, I don’t know if I’d settle for an apple. I think I’d steal apples until he’d come out and settle the question himself. Then I’d know where that line that Hugo talked about was drawn—at least when it came to stealing apples, and only from that particular billionaire. Yet, I had no idea how to draw the line for anything else. Especially not money. Each line would be arbitrary. And really, every life would dwindle that line down to nothing, so that no one could own anything until all life was infinitely preserved. By that point, I don’t know if a deathless life was really even life at all. Like an infinite life to them would be just as good as this one, so they’d have all the time in the world to throw a ball against the wall mindlessly day after day. And to be frank, I really don’t know if preserving that was worth the trouble.</p>
<p>These houses, after all, were as bare as the stock black and gray and white cars I worked on each day. There was no uniqueness. No life. Not even a single piece of art adorned the walls other than football teams and band posters. Even in their journals, their thoughts ran dry as though they had no clue how to word their feelings even when the vastness of their world was limited by their ability to do so. Journals like the one in my hand that I found hidden atop a shelving unit. Maybe their beauty in life was just different, I guess.</p>
<p>There is a contrast within the houses themselves, though. I can tell the difference between a kid’s room and an adult’s room without knowing where in the house it is. A parent is orderly, organized, ordinary, and obstinate. There’s a large bed and a dresser and too small a television upon that dresser and a clock set to ring at six in the morning and not much else, as they have the whole house to put their stuff. But a child is limited to their room and limited to the things in life they have been given. Their rooms are cluttered and chaotic, as they still have much more important things in life to concern themselves with—who they are and the first and most important path they must choose to take in a few years that is always too late or too early but never when they are ready. They take comfort in the escape from reality, often mixing the too and dreaming bigger than anyone wants them to, and not knowing how to tackle the reality in front of them yet with all the motivation to do so. Instead of wrestling with God and placing the blame of their pain on him, they wrestle with their parents who are all too complacent with the world—and they’re usually right.</p>
<p>Then they grow older, their rooms become proportionally mundane to their solidification in it, with only traces to the inner child they wished to be again, until soon they get their own house and their room to look like their parents and their kids’ rooms to look like theirs as kids. But the house remains a house. There is no living room for commune. No place of study or peace. No place to craft art or any other creative pursuit. If I were to ask them, they would ferociously nod, finish my sentence, and interrupt saying they outta do it. But never do. They never do what they say they should. I don’t know why. It drives me insane.</p>
<p>These people will agree their life is a mess. That it’s incongruent, cemented, hopeless, unappealing, and bleak, then blame it on their view of an incongruent, cemented, hopeless, unappealing, and bleak world, as if the one piece of the world they have total control over isn’t bland only and solely because of themselves. But it’s a view, nothing more. Much like the Mona Lisa is just canvas and oil, until you become an artist yourself and see the beauty in it. The human body carbon and water, until you become a human yourself, and the arrangement of molecules becomes sacred.</p>
<p>I’ve cycled my own views with each house I stepped into. I’d think that the Earth was simply a daycare for our naïve spirits to mature before moving on. I’d become convinced that Earth was merely designed to make you as complacent with the bare minimum so the afterlife didn’t look so bad. I’d believe that the evolution of life was the universe’s front on its own existence.</p>
<p>Each view was just as valid as the next, for it was impossible to reason and base belief upon fact. Ultimately, only fact would bring closure, and it is fact alone that is taught in school—of atoms and evolution and cells. If one was to search for meaning, having never been taught how to think for themselves, they would cling to the notion that all was the same type of fact of the only facts they knew, based in the natural processes of the world. Not that any of them actually understood the facts, for if they did, they would understand that even those facts were hardly understood to begin with, and that truly this world was more magical the more one tried to understand it.</p>
<p>But it is no revelation that everyone treated the magic as ordinary as anything else. Much like these natural processes of rain or wind or electricity, it seemed that everyone clung to the viewpoints of least resistance, those that came most naturally, and then buried their heads in the sand against any other explanation. Fair enough, life is hard and painful. It is easier to munch on chocolate and grow fat than take to the streets and run until you couldn’t run anymore. But shouldn’t one care about oneself enough to be content with pain? Aren’t we are all in in this one life?</p>
<p>Nothing is more irritating than seeing a stream flow blindly in the path the water before it has made when there is a canyon parallel. But who can blame the water? Do you think it is possible for a man who does not know how to measure anything not to believe that he is four cubits tall when many others, who are similarly ignorant, tell him that he is?</p>
<p>All I can think about is that path Bobby talked so much about. All of us droplets of water follow the same path until we reach our end and are evaporated back into the atmosphere, so that the next generation of water will fall upon the mountain sides and find its way back to that same path, down to the same destination only to evaporate once more in an endless cycle of meaninglessly carving deeper basins.</p>
<p>But the sad thing is, we were all at the top of this mountain side at one point. We could see the world to be explored below, and the only thing that held us back were walls that could be torn down had we all joined together to break them. Then as we got older, people started giving up, then as the feat appeared to be more and more hopeless, it eventually became hopeless, and soon I felt alone on the path of beating against the walls of my being while everyone else patted me on the back like I was still this naively hopeful kid still thinking the world we all saw at the top wasn’t a mirage. I was sad because I knew that if we had all beat against these walls and strove to eradicate death and understand our minds, instead of growing old and fat, we would have done so by now, and that I was born too early to experience these miracles.</p>
<p>Then I reluctantly joined the nihilistic waterslide too.</p>
<p>And there I found Hugo, poking me with a stick like the asshole he is. He reminded me that I was only so deeply disappointed with the world because I really cared about the world, as a parent would their child. I cried that nothing was more real than the pain that I felt. He replied that love was more real. That love makes us humans take all the courage we can muster to take on the pain. That because I loved the world, I had a moral responsibility to overcome my troubles, become a better man, and make the world a better place. </p>
<p>Hugo showed me that even if I knew no meaning in life, I could at least find meaning in my pursuit of it.</p>
<p>Headlight shone in through the windows. The garage rumbled as its door screeched its way up. Headlights shone in through the windows. The garage rumbled as its door screeched its way up. I raised myself off the bed and set the journal back atop the shelf and gently shut the bedroom door behind me. A door on the other side of the house opened and with it voices of kids bickering amongst themselves and rushing to their rooms. I made my way to the backdoor, hearing their trampling footsteps around the corner behind me. They were so anxious to resume their play, so happy and grateful to be in the world that they couldn’t get enough of it. Where did that drive of mine go? </p>
<p>I reached the backdoors in the kitchen. It was dreadfully dark outside. My image reflected off the glass as the living room lights sparked on and streamed into the kitchen over the counter. It was merely a translucent image. I wish I could have seen my face. It felt like a mess. I unlocked the latch and slid the door open, then stepped out into the chilling breeze. The parents yelled at the kids from the living room to get their snacks before bed. I slid the door shut behind me and strolled back to my car parked down the street, eager to have found a light that was different than the kitchen light that lit up my back. A light that Hugo pointed to like a star and said that was the one I was looking for.</p>
