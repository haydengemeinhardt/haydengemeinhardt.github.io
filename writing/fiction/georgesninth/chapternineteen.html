<p>The late fall sun fell before I reached the Lebedev household. Silhouettes danced in the curls of curtains. Shouting permeated through the glass to tell the story. It was like watching a dramatic play from the back row of a vast theater.</p>
<p>With George and Jenny removed, their house was unfamiliar. It felt empty. Not vacant, but not full. A liminal mall that hadn’t shut down despite its anchors gone.</p>
<p>“How can they deny the claim?” Mr. Lebedev’s deep voice struck through the glass. “Why do they always have to be a pain in the ass?”</p>
<p>“I’ll call tomorrow,” Mrs. Lebedeva yelled back. “You’re always losing your mind over unimportant things.”</p>
<p>“This is thousands of dollars!”</p>
<p>“We’ll just have to set up a payment plan.”</p>
<p>“Sure, let’s just set up a plan for everyone. Let the whole family get fucked, why not?”</p>
<p>The sound of a passing car blasting music out of open windows muffled half of any reply; not that I was particularly against living like you have the same claim to the world as everyone else, but in the moment, I cursed them under my breath.</p>
<p>Mrs. Levedeva’s voice reemerged through the window. “It’s not like you were ever home to know them anyway.”</p>
<p>“Because I was working to cover bills like this,” Mr. Lebedev yelled as a glass broke against the floor.</p>
<p>The doorbell daintily chimed as my finger hit its button, and the fighting ceased in the ring’s drop off. Neither of them immediately answered. I could only imagine that they were exchanging glances as to who should answer the door. Might it be the police, or a concerned neighbor?</p>
<p>It was Mr. Lebedev who eventually opened the door. He held it slightly open in such a way that he could soon close it, and stared at me with a reticent, blank expression. His dress shirt was half untucked from his black pants and his tie was loosened, as though the bill interrupted his undoing of it. Despite his drained appearance, his posture stiffened after realized it was me, Mickey Lee. He fully opened the door, and leaned one hand up against the frame and stuffed the other into his pocket.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lebedeva appeared behind him and pushed him aside. “It’s been so long since we’ve seen you.”</p>
<p>I cupped the back of my neck. “I’m sorry about what happened.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. We’ve been quite distressed.” She lifted her hand to Mr. Drussel’s back and looked up at him to catch a glance of agreement, who laconically replied “Quite so.” Then she turned back to me and said, “So what do we owe the pleasure?”</p>
<p>“I want to see Jenny,” I said. No hesitation. No blurt. “The hospital won’t let non-family see her.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lebedeva smiled and touched my shoulder, rubbing her thumb against it. Mr. Lebedev frowned, likely wondering how far I was going to shove myself into their family affairs.</p>
<p>“We were just about to visit her,” Mrs. Lebedeva replied. “Or at least, I was, if you need to go to bed, honey.”</p>
<p>“I could stay up all night, honey,” he returned, then turned to me. “Although, I don’t think they’ll allow you to see her.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” said Mrs. Lebedeva, “if we give him our permission.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want Mickey to go all the way up there only to be turned away. He can just see her when she’s better.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” I interrupted. “If they turn me away, I’ll leave. But I want to try regardless. And I won’t stay long, I just want to see how she’s doing.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s that,” said Mrs. Lebedeva. “Give us a couple of minutes, and you can follow us there.”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>George’s father wasn’t irascible. It was the first time I had seen him like that since George nearly totaled his car. It wasn’t the cost of repairing the car that pissed him off. It was George almost throwing his life away so early. Tossing it into the wind, not holding it dear enough. He was mad for no other reason than the selfish love for his son.</p>
<p>I could only imagine how he would blow up at Jenny, although, after hearing him earlier, I didn’t seem to think that he cared equally as much between the two, even if the cost was less crippling.</p>
<p>I followed the couple down the hallway while they bickered at each other, continuing on from what must have been a quarrelsome car ride. It made us a spotlight amongst the others who silently confined themselves to chairs that periodically lined the walls. Those that had been there a while were tucked under blankets holding styrofoam cups of cold coffee and a wad of wrappers from nearby overpriced vending machines, as their loved ones were tucked away in some numbered, overpriced pod. Reticently staring into the bleakness, distinct from the late comers still clearly immersed in shrouded emotion.</p>
<p>The white noise of the local news tried to fill the silence, but no one ever turned to the news to feel better about the world. And the fluorescent lights dimly yellowing the halls did little to help the atmosphere. If heaven and hell were opposite sides of a spectrum, the hospital hallway would extend it juxtaposed against the hospital hallways portrayed in the television dramas teeming with overworked doctors brushing shoulders against bustling nurses reeling hospital beds and I.V. stands in the ambience of beeping heart monitors.</p>
<p>The Lebedevs stopped arguing as they pushed through one last set of doors and approached a front counter to get directed to Jenny’s room. The nurse looked up from her computer and eyeballed me peering between their shoulders.</p>
<p>“Sorry, only two visitors allowed at a time.” </p>
<p>Jenny’s parents turned around where I had been hiding behind them. It was like I was a pest they forgot about amongst their dispute.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” I spat.</p>
<p>“It’s for the patient’s well being,” said the nurse.</p>
<p>Mr. Lebedev turned to me. “I tried to tell you.”</p>
<p>I nearly returned the nurse’s words with a flurry of blistering assertions, to stir up so much commotion in the hall that it would force her into repudiating ever having said so, just to confute that smug face of Mr. Lebedev’s otherwise, until I realized that, indeed, placing myself in the midst of family affairs like that would probably be too awkward of a situation to salvage anyway.</p>
<p>“Just give me ten minutes,” I said, “then I’ll leave.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lebedev sighed and looked at the clock on the wall as though I would go away by expression alone, knowing any other confrontation would leave him dealing with Mrs. Lebedeva and the following embarrassment of cold-heartedly turning me away. But I knew him and he knew me–I wasn’t turning away to anything less than a call to security. </p>
<p>“Five,” he said. “You have five minutes.”</p>
<p>I thanked him and strode past the counter, counting the numbers of the rooms until Jenny’s room number appeared. Room 6035. The door was cracked open. </p>
<p>A couple walked out of the neighboring room, slowly closing the door so as to not make a noise. We locked eyes and they smiled in a way that said everything was going to be alright.</p>
<p>Time was ticking. I took a deep breath outside the door and knocked on it three times before pushing it open.</p>
<p>The room was as quiet as the hall, that the faint footsteps of the couple walking past would perk a dog’s ear. There were no beeping heart monitors or I.V.s snaking over the bed. Just Jenny curled up under a wool blanket on the far side of the room, staring out at the busy lights of the city in one of those blue-padded hospital chairs the doctor would make you sit in during a check up, looking back out to the red and white lights of the cars gridding the city into a series of squares lining the central river. Six stories was not high up, but it was high enough to peek over the strips of buildings across the flat landscape until the city’s bright bubble of light faded into the dark behind distant trees.</p>
<p>Jenny twisted her head to the door. She slipped her arms under the blanket. A shade of pink swept her cheeks.</p>
<p>I smiled and gently shut the door, the kind of way you twist the knob as if someone was asleep. I had gotten quite good at it. Then I sauntered to the window, past the white bed against gray walls and white floors, and looked past my faint reflection out into the night city as I often did from my own room.</p>
<p>“That’s a shame,” I said. “There’s no drops on this window.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Remember when we would place bets on the raindrops racing to the bottom of the windowpane?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” she said. “Yeah.”</p>
<p>I dug in my pocket and pulled out a snack pack of Oreos. “I guess I lost that bet.”</p>
<p>“But it hasn’t even rained.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “It felt like a night that it would.”</p>
<p>I tore open the package and offered her an Oreo. She kept her hands beneath the blanket. I moved it near her mouth, and she bit into it, then I took a bite of it as well.</p>
<p>“It really is a nice sight,” I said, swallowing my bite. “How long have you been sitting here looking at it?”</p>
<p>“A couple of hours,” she replied. “The world looks so much bigger up here.”</p>
<p>Her replies were casual and relaxed, which threw me off, but I played along.</p>
<p>“In a hopeful sort of way?”</p>
<p>“No, it makes me feel so much smaller and insignificant.”</p>
<p>“In what sense?”</p>
<p>“That it squeezes the hope out of escaping the loop of showering, eating, working, eating, working, dozing off at the TV and then doing it all over again until I die.”</p>
<p>“It needn’t be that way,” I said. “I don’t quite understand it all yet, but I think it is a mistake to simplify the absurdity of our lives into such terms, and that disconnection is what makes us so depressed. But I also think that we just do it because we don’t have the words to explain otherwise.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Cool.” She heard me, but it didn’t affect her one bit. Not in the way that it swept me like a flood. She didn’t understand. She didn’t care. How could she when I gave her seconds to do that which took me months? I was doing that thing, where I tried to help instead of just listening to her.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said, “It was just something I wish someone had said to me.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay.”</p>
<p>I offered her another Oreo, but she ignored it. I set the package on the windowsill and dusted my hands. I don’t know why I brought them; they were of poor taste for the occasion.</p>
<p>I found a nearby chair and pulled it close to the window across from her. We sat in silence for almost a minute as we gazed at the cityscape. I would have sat with her until the sun burned out if the time I was given permitted it. Please talk. Please let me be your shoulder to cry on. I didn’t mean to ruin that trust.</p>
<p>I turned my gaze back to her, only to see her eyes red and watery. “Jenny, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“I’m really, really sorry about that night,” she said.</p>
<p>“There’s no night I’m aware of that you need to be sorry about.”</p>
<p>“That night you guys ran late because of me. Because I didn’t finish my work on time.”</p>
<p>“Is that what this is about?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.” She buried her face in her knees.</p>
<p>There was no need to hound her about how absurd the connection was, and no point in downplaying her feelings. I had done the same thing all but moments ago. But to go so far over such tangential guilt? It was that Lebedev spark in her that I always admired in George.</p>
<p>“I used to be horrendously jealous of you and George,” I said. “I used to be obsessed with stories, ever since it was time to write applications, and you two had stories.”</p>
<p>She wiped her eyes, sniffed her nose, and looked back at me. “I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>The only tissues were on the bed-side table. “Stories,” I repeated, rising to fetch the box, “like significant things that happen to people. I wanted one for myself, very badly.”</p>
<p>“Like bad things?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.” It was a short walk. I handed her a tissue and set the box next to the Oreos. “I know it sounds weird, but I wanted them because I thought they would bring me validation and meaning and a rage-filled passion. I always saw it in George when we ran and it made me jealous because I didn’t have anything like that. I was just a nobody that nothing ever happened to, and no college or anyone would ever want a nobody. But then you showed up at work. Or, I guess I did, but you showed me that what I actually needed was a new perspective, and I didn’t need stories to do that. And you saved me from a really dark place.”</p>
<p>From the corner of my eye, down at the street below, two police cruisers sped along its length up to the base of the building. I had only just got there, and it was time for me to leave. </p>
<p>“I wanted to thank you,” I said, “for what it’s worth.”</p>
<p>“Is that why you came here?”</p>
<p>“Well, in part, but I also wanted to see how you were feeling--”</p>
<p>“I feel nothing, if that’s what you’re asking. All of this, and I feel nothing. Everyone expects me to feel one way or another, but I don’t.”</p>
<p>“I did not come here expecting anything of you.”</p>
<p>“Then why did you come?”</p>
<p> “I came because I wanted to see you.”</p>
<p>“Even in this state?”</p>
<p>“Yes, no matter what state you would be in.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I love you.”</p>
<p>She froze and grew pale. She darted her head back to the window and let her hair flow down to shield her face.</p>
<p>“I used to be scared to admit it,” I continued, “but I don’t care anymore. I’ll scream it from the streets or the rooftops if you so please. I love you.” </p>
<p>She started to stammer, but I interrupted and spoke quickly, “Not because I have some use or expectation from you. It hurts me to see you think that. No, I love you because you grew to be my dearest friend who always cheered me up. Because you pulled me from a deep abyss. Because you made my world meaningful in ways I don’t know how to describe. It’s not something I can lie about or hide any longer. You changed my world such that that wouldn’t be possible. And even if I never see or hear from you again, I want you to know there’s at least one person in this world who truly loves you for you.”</p>
<p>I ended my speech promptly. My heart paced so quickly that I was unable to string anymore words together. It was then that I was ready to bolt out the door as I had already overstayed my welcome, but Jenny shed her blanket and rose to wrap her arms around me despite the bandages that stuck to them. She clung to the back of my shirt and burrowed her face in shoulder. My heart pounded like it had never beat before. I had to run. It was in my blood. Yet, her grasp was so she would never let go of me if for her own sake. Her whimpers permeated my body as though it were glass, and her tears on my shirt were like rain against curtains of an open window into the home of my heart.</p>
<p>Thus it shall be.</p>
<p>I put one hand on her back and the other in her hair. When she calmed down, she rose her chin onto the damp cloth and rested her head against mine. As she looked through the window that showed her a world she did not know how to answer, I stared at the door, and we held onto each other tight.</p>
<p>She kissed my neck, and I kissed her lips, and we both smiled against each other, and when we pulled away, the door burst open, and two cops told me to raise my hands, and I rose them, and I was handcuffed and led away from Jenny and I don’t know what she might’ve felt because I never looked back.</p>
