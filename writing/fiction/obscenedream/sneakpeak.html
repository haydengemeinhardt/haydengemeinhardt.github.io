<p>Lucas always said the day I could outrun him on our route would be the day he would be fine with me talking to Jenny. I never could tell if he was joking; Jenny and I hung out alone once and he and Hugo never let it go. He also said it would be that day he would divulge his big secret. I assumed it was a bluff to provoke what competition he could get out of me, but today I took him up on that offer. Needless to say, I ran the last mile in the dust.
</p>
<p>	Rounding the final stop sign, one marked by its blinding reflection of the sun in its polished state, one that promptly replaced the old sign drunkenly bent into the dirt after an executive’s party with too much champagne, my house came into view, Lucas on its porch with a folded newspaper in one hand and tea in the other, talking to my mother as casually as one could sweaty, breathless, and shirtless.</p>
<p>	Running was an integral aspect of his life, as much as a morning coffee is to those who find no other motivation to get out of bed. What difference there was between it and succumbing to other human instincts Lucas so often criticized wasn’t one he could establish beyond the mental accomplishment. And even then, the dopamine rush was not disparate to any other dopamine rush.</p>
<p>	But he would still imbue it with visceral music and embrace a state of mind that brought out the emancipating dreams we all dream, to experience them with the pains and joys of it all together. It was his journey in life that no one else could comprehend, all its ups and downs a part of a story separate from reality; and in that, no one cared, because no one truly appreciated embracing an aspect of life such as that. People with the gift of a human mind, antithetically devoid of the discipline or desire for dramatizing physical and mental struggles in life beyond what they have yet to overcome.
