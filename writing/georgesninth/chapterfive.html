								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Five</h1><br>
<p>The world moved fast when I was young. With no effort, the world loosened its constraints and opened itself up to me simply because time had passed, and it passed fast! One day, I’d suddenly be allowed to stay outside with my friends after dark. Then another, I’d be able to shed my bedtime. Then I could drive, and even tell an adult to fuck off (and who could blame kids for becoming obsessed with such a power?). Each year, I was left wondering what was next. But the years had slowed down. My heart was becoming impatient.</p>
<p>I was also a curious child. Adults hated my nosing around every nook and cranny investigating how the world functioned behind the curtains. I wanted to know what life was like in a random town on the other side of the world or what the underside of an airplane looked like or the backroom of a thrift store. But the answer was always boring when I found out. For once, I wanted to be as fascinated as my imagination had been gripped, and I began to realize that I had to cross the boundaries of my comfort. Maybe even the boundaries I thought that I could never cross. The boundaries that were taboo and universal, the ones that stopped me from going places I was not allowed go—to roam the White House or a billionaire’s Manhattan penthouse or the Lascaux cave or Vatican secret archives.</p>
<p>Thus, naturally, my mind had set my dream in a world that had been vacated, standing across the street from a house I used to pass by on the bus daily during middle school that fancied all the adorations I held as a kid. It was the kind of home one would imagine Miss Peregrine to own: a three story manor whose windows dotted the façade at varying heights and spiraled around a tower on the corner, recessed behind a black-steel fence split between columns of red brick and exaggerated by a warm, blossoming garden in juxtaposition to the cold, modern homes lining the nearby streets.</p>
<p>I pushed through two heavy doors into a grand entryway, where a dark wood staircase flanked by two marble busts bisected the upper floors under a crystal chandelier. I wandered through an impossibly large labyrinth of archways and stumbled upon awe at every turn. Art worthy of a museum adorned the walls. Homemade sweets stockpiled the kitchen. A magical, or haunted, study had pens and papers fluttering about as rain pounded against the windows trying to put out the candlelight. Atop a ladder was a chilly attic full of antiques and chests of clothes and a dusty wardrobe of coats and mothballs.</p>
<p>Wandering the house, I searched for hidden rooms and long lost secrets, until the front door swung open to a lively family who had returned home, forcing me to flee through the back in an adrenaline rush.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>How uneventful the dream was, yet what a thrill! What an adventure to partake on, only to return to the mundane world of unvarying tasks. How was I supposed to continue my day as though nothing happened?</p>
<p>I had asked the question once before, to myself and then to Lucas—who I knew wanted to live a dream as much as I—and his response was utterly disappointing. He regurgitated the stoic teachings taught in class that had been so deeply ingrained into society I couldn’t tell if it was innate or ingenious. They say forget the dream! The reality of living in a dream world is beyond my control, and so I ought to discard it entirely. To lobotomize myself to the impossibility of living in a world dictated by my own rose tinted glasses. They might’ve been right, had the house not existed and had there been something to prevent me from entering it bar a value that lost its worth in my dream.</p>
<p>Then, in the unwonted disappearance of such a value, the question must be asked: is one not the truest form of oneself in dreams where they are left to roam like a dog whose leash had been relinquished? And if the dog concomitantly chases after a tale, could one declare the dog to not actually want to tale? For the person dreamt is no different than the person dreaming, as though dreams are a nightly test of one's character.</p>
<p>If I believed it was the consequence that determined whether what I did was right or wrong, then no one would ever need to know I snuck into that house. Conversely, if I believed it was dependent upon principle, then it stood to say anyone who has wronged in their dream has committed such a sin in their heart. Were I to gouge out my dreams and throw them away? All the more call for a lobotomy! But if I believed entering the house to be wrong, then I would not have done it, thus the principle was as non-existent as the consequence.</p>
<p>Truly then, how was I supposed to continue my day when my heart had subconsciously shifted behind my back to present me with the opportunity of an attainable dream?</p>
<p>By the time the question had been asked, I was already up and working away in the shop, depressingly, irritably, obliviously, like the slow, waking loss of a dream without an answer and without need of one, for I only cared about the only answer I cared about when I had energy far removed from sleep.</p>
<p>Jenny appeared from the corner of my eye, her heavy footsteps against the concrete giving herself away. Her hair was lackadaisically wrapped into a bun and her t-shirt was baggy and worked with wrinkles. She yawned and squinted away from the sun as she walked. I put on a smile and finished tightening a bolt.</p>
<p>“You tired too?” Jenny asked, rubbing her eyes.</p>
<p>“Kind of,” I said.</p>
<p>“You literally looked like you were still asleep.”</p>
<p>“Just distracted.”</p>
<p>“Distracted about what?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” I said, “What’s up?”</p>
<p>She looked at me questionably before shaking off the thought. “I need you to pull that car around for me.” She pointed to a white Datsun out front. “Another manual.”</p>
<p>I slammed the trunk shut and set my tools on the bench. “Wanna take over here for me then?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” she said, tossing me the keys.</p>
<p>“Then why not get someone else to do it?”</p>
<p>“Because I like telling you what to do.”</p>
<p>She continued past me, ready to ignore any further words I had to say. I didn’t have any, though, when before I would have demanded she explain herself. She was an unmasked, unapologetic version of a girl I could understand and accept.</p>
<p>I walked to the Datsun, carelessly tossing the keys from one hand to the other. It was an older car that at first sight one might guess needed as much work as Jenny’s car. However, the manuals of Newport were not manuals because they were old; if they were old, they weren’t old because they were cheap. They were Sunday morning cars that every God-loving Newportian splurged on in the name of charity, as their benevolent god encouraged almsgiving in the form of trickle-down economics.</p>
<p>I lowered myself into the car, shut the door, and twisted the key. The engine ignited. The car purred along my fingertips on its steering wheel and against my foot on its brake. All the vibrations that brought the car to life—the orchestra crafted to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars—conglomerated into a sour taste in my mouth. It was not of jealousy as it would be for every other native Newportian. It was of disappointment. In the cupholder was a piece of gum that I plucked and plopped into my mouth to wash away the taste with a sweet minty release. It was the most mundane of thrills, wrapped neatly like a candy, thrice removed from the dream, as meaningless as rolling down the window to flip someone off in traffic—yet people tend to do that anyway if not for the release they find in their heart.</p>
<p>I drove the Datsun around to the spot Jenny was waiting and got out.</p>
<p>“Bobby wants to talk to you by the way,” she said as I handed her the keys.</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Maybe his dog or something.”</p>
<p>She motioned to the other side of the garage where Daniel was showing Bobby various parts under the hood of a car. Bobby reached in and finagled a piece, then looked to Daniel who shook his head and pointed once more. By the time I approached them, Bobby was two hands deep.</p>
<p>“You needed something, Bobby?”</p>
<p>“In a couple of minutes,” he grunted, pulling out a piece of the car, “me and you are headed out.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>He straightened and took a breath. “I’ll tell you on the way. Just grab your lunch and we’ll get going.”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Bobby’s truck sputtered as it crested over Paula Bridge. The faint fragrance of pinewood lingered from a tea tree that swung under the rearview mirror. Bobby leaned comfortably on his hand propped against the windowsill with his other hand rested on the steering wheel, whilst I swung with the air freshener at each bump in the road on the leather bench seat. It was like the bus seats I grew up with, but buses were larger, like a cruise ship that rode smoothly across waves.</p>
<p>The bridge was one of the few crossings over the river which bisected Newport and segregated it accordingly, for the same reason that it was one of the few times that I crossed over it never having need except to pass through the other side of town on some road trip. The innocent kid I used to be would look behind in awe at the picturesque embodiment of Newport: a cluster of newly-built highrises, a shore lined with sandy beaches and docks, and wealthy homes stretching into the hills—the home I was leaving behind to go on some adventure. However, in the passenger seat of Bobby’s truck, the childish fantasy disappeared. I didn’t twist onto my knees in the car seat to look out the rear window. I only saw that which laid plainly across the bridge in front of us: the other half of Newport, a suburban grid where the early morning sun lit the east-side rooves and stretched shadows onto the streets like zebra stripes. The less-city-more-residential section forgotten and tossed aside into a separate county with a landmark bill, despite the municipality of Newport still stretching far across it.</p>
<p>I never understood the logistics of such a split, and thus never paid much attention to it. I only knew of the city that I learned in school, in which they said Newport was an old town (as old as an American town could be) established by British aristocracy for the bustling colonial tobacco trade at the time, and, more importantly, that the British were overthrown during the revolution in turn for a freer society. How could I have ignored reality any longer? British or American, the city’s roots were never uprooted and repaved. There was merely the changing of the flag that I’d have to pledge allegiance to every morning.</p>
<p>But it was the birth of the American dream, they said! The possibility to move across the river, that one didn’t have to be adopted into nobility; they simply had to be luckier than that. That was their definition of a dream. How laughable! And as long as one played the game, they were always guaranteed a comfortable spot on the upper floors of an office building to look down on everyone else. Thus that’s what people did. Played the game like everyone else. Exploit or be exploited. What else was there to commit one’s life to?</p>
<p><i>Where are you guys going?</i> Jenny texted me.</p>
<p>It was a question I still had myself, so I turned to Bobby and asked.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “on Sundays, I go out and fix cars without a fee for those that otherwise couldn’t afford it. It’s a little deal I worked out with Mr. Martin who is kind enough to support it.”</p>
<p>“That’s actually really kind,” I said. “But why did you want me to come along?”</p>
<p>“You’re young and nimble and full of energy. I’m tired and my back hurts.”</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Apparently an on-the-go repair shop.</i></p>
<p><i>Is it an all-day repair shop?</i></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Not sure.</i></p>
<p>A few miles later, the truck wobbled over a curb into an old driveway where grass poked between cracks. Well-tended plants sprouted from pots lining the railing of a small patio whose wooden steps creaked under our weight. Bobby knocked against the door and a moment later, an old woman pulled it open with a man in a wheelchair at her side.</p>
<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Polk, how are you doing this morning?”</p>
<p>“We’re doing great, Bobby,” the woman said with a hoarse voice. “Who’s this fine young man?”</p>
<p>“This is Mickey. He’s helping me out today.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Polk stepped outside and gave me a gentle hug. “The world needs more people like you darling.”</p>
<p>What would she have said if she knew I was only out there because Bobby dragged me along?</p>
<p>“Good seeing you, Bobby,” Mr. Polk said as he rolled to the door and our hands. “I don’t want to take up too much of your time.”</p>
<p>“It’s no problem at all. It is your truck with an issue?”</p>
<p>“Can’t get the thing to start,” he said. “I’d do it myself, but my body just isn’t what it used to be.”</p>
<p>Bobby laughed and grabbed my shoulder. “That’s why I got Mickey here. We’ll get it fixed.”</p>
<p>After a few trailing niceties, Mrs. Polk closed the door to go open the garage and Bobby and I left to get tools from the truck.</p>
<p>“How do you know them?” I asked, stepping down the porch behind Bobby.</p>
<p>“Those folks are from my church.”</p>
<p>“All the way out here?”</p>
<p>“I live around here,” Bobby said, “and it’s my community. I’ve been a part of it since I was a kid, riding my bike with my friends along this very road…” He stopped and looked up and down the road, his hands to his hips, nodding slowly as if recalling memories. Then his reminiscence faded from his eyes as he swatted the air with his hand and continued to his truck. “Your generation wouldn’t understand. Too busy on your phones.”</p>
<p>As we fixed the Polks’ truck, Bobby explained how the Polks had to rely on their neighbors to get groceries and take them to the doctor, and that my help was significantly impacting their lives. Yet, I was doing nothing at all except what Bobby commanded of me. Where was the good in what I did?</p>
<p>It took until Mrs. Polk’s bright smile as the truck sputtered alive to toss aside the thought and comprehend that I, Mickey Lee, with less than a hundred dollars to my name, had an impact on their lives. Such a feeling was alien to me; complacency nearly made me discard it. But I caught it, and gripped it tight, and accepted their thanks with joy in my heart—to dream of living a day as George. Maybe inconsequential, yet had every day brought feelings as such, I would’ve never gotten lost on my path.</p>
<p>At least, “path” is the word Bobby chose.</p>
<p><i>Another manual.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><i>I guess I’ll have to teach you one day.</i></p>
<p>The typing text bubble popped up. I curled my toes. Then the bubble disappeared.</p>
<p>The truck squeaked to a halt and the gear shift churned as Bobby switched to park on the outskirts of a supermarket parking lot under the shade of a sprawling tree. The sun flickered into my eyes through gaps in branches that shifted in the breeze. In an adjacent spot idly sat rusted van with rolled down windows. A man, who I presumed to be Steven, leaned against its driver-side door. He donned an off-white tank top, basketball shorts that desperately clung to his waist, and worn sneakers. His hair was curly and thin, his teeth yellow and missing, his arms thin and bruised.</p>
<p>The truck rocked as Bobby stepped out and slammed the door shut. He walked around the front and met the man halfway. They shook hands and spoke with muffled voices through the glass. I slid my phone into my pocket and opened the door. Bobby’s voice switched from a muffle to a whisper as the racing of cars on the highway overtook it like white noise in the background. The cloud of fumes struck like mustard gas against the pine fragrance of the truck. Stepping out, I caught sight of a mess of a van through its rolled down windows. Stevem wasn’t even trying to hide it. I thought, by the look of him, it wouldn’t do any benefit to hide his things had an officer approached him. And I thought, maybe for his own sake, that situation might be the best for him.</p>
<p>Bobby passed me on his way to the back of the truck. I followed behind him. He popped open the hatch to the bed neatly packed with various tools and specific parts needed for the individual stops and reached in to collect the equipment. I glimpsed over my shoulder at Steven, who was leaning against the van looking the opposite way, before I whispered to Bobby, “You know he is a drug addict, right?”</p>
<p>“Not everyone is perfect.”</p>
<p>“Should we really be helping him?” I questioned. “With all the money he spends on—”</p>
<p>Anger swelled in Bobby’s eyes. He smacked me upside the head. “You don’t think it’s help that he needs?”</p>
<p>I recoiled a step, like a dog fussed at for following its natural instinct, who had never known its owner was capable of such anger and was more ashamed and confused than scared or angry. And I should’ve been angry, for as the saying goes, men are only supposed to feel happy, horny, hungry, or angry, and to veer from that was childish. But I had grown the utmost respect for Bobby, so much that I had locked only two possible emotions to him—happy or hungry—and his venturing from the two was what left me in pause.</p>
<p>Bobby finished collecting the equipment in silence and returned to the front of the van with the supplies in hand. He worked effortlessly on his own, chatting with Steven whilst asking for tools I handed him from the side. His whole show was a mockery of mine, a demonstration of the burden I was that Bobby had fooled me into thinking otherwise. I wanted to believe I was of help. I wanted the thanks that the Polks had tricked me into longing. But even the most cunning idiot could not fool themselves, for there was no question—Steven shook Bobby’s hand alone and we were on to the next stop in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>The truck bobbled out of the parking lot and twisted sharply onto the highway. The pine tree and I swung in unison while Bobby caught up to the speed of traffic. Driving demanded an aggressive style at times, but there was a lingering irritation with Bobby.</p>
<p>The next light turned yellow, and Bobby slowed the truck. Then he took a deep sigh and asked, “Do you think you’re better than Steven?”</p>
<p>I held my tongue and thought carefully as one does when asked a question like that. I sat up in my seat, put my hand on my chin, and gazed absently to the ceiling. But Bobby set aside the rhetorical question—a sly hint he knew the answer better than me—and continued with another, “You know what he does for a living? He sits near a bridge with a group of other guys every morning, waiting for a truck to pull over and hire help for the day mowing lawns or cleaning pools in the hills. He can’t get a job because he has no home and has no home because he can’t get a job. So yes, he has problems. What more do you expect?”</p>
<p>Bobby paused after posing his question. But he wasn’t awaiting an answer. I knew better and waited for him to finish. The light turned green. The engine filled the silence as Bobby accelerated alongside the other cars.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Bobby said. “I knew Steven. Went to school with him. He was no different than the rest of us, just like you and Jenny and all of your friends are now. You have to remember we all walk on the same path. Some of us trip along the way, some of us find short cuts, some of us just enjoy the walk. But we are all human and we are all going to the same destination. Whether you run the path or walk it or get off early, doesn’t really matter—you’re no better than anyone else. I know it’s hard to accept that at your age.”</p>
<p>And it was! How outrageous it was to proclaim no one better than another, not Hitler nor Ghandi than I—or to proclaim that we held the potential to be better but to strive for it was out of the question (is that not a cruel thing to say in itself?). For Bobby—someone who I believed much wiser, more experienced, cleverer than I, and that I still equally respected despite his outburst—to spew such nonsense was for some clandestine spirit to tape open my eyelids and beat me with a stick until the imagine was ingrained in me. Surely, he didn’t believe George and I followed the same path, that Lucas and I lived the same stories, that the forks in my path were imagined?</p>
<p>Bobby said it was hard to see at my age—he who had not dreamt of being king since the Reagan administration; He who believed a god wept as its son was brutally sacrificed for him, squeezing all other paths into a narrow corridor in comparison. Were I to live a thousand lives, I’d never come close. To paint a thousand paintings and never craft the Mona Lisa, the most praised of all work that shadows any other. Yet, to have a god weep for you, would that not drive a man radical? Or how about the man who sits at home contributing nothing to society, would it not drive them suicidal? Or the man who lost their chance at accomplishing their dreams, just slipping between their fingers, would it not make them grasp for it the rest of their lives? Would it not make them want to live a thousand lives regardless?</p>
<p>No! A screaming, piercing “No!” that silenced all who weren’t part of the cry. It was the no that a child receives from their parents, whose questioning was met with an agonizing “because I said so”, an “I cannot explain” disguised as “I don’t feel like explaining”—both equally insulting to my childish ears. There was something I was missing, something I did not understand and would not understand until I too had grown old and wrung my heart on Bobby’s universal path where everyone’s failures collected into a great river basin, mirky and bleak, polluted with the stench of monotony. Is that not the impending doom I was facing?</p>
<p>Yes! For the next day in class, I was returned my semester’s English essay with an F circumnavigated in red ink, a screaming, piercing “Yes!” that my entire life’s work of perfection—an impeccable demonstration of my tunnel visioned commitment to expectations—was suddenly tarnished in a single stroke. It was my only hope of ever getting into Valencia, my only hope of ever living just a single dream like George. I imagined it was like if Bobby died and never found heaven. But of course, Bobby didn’t seem to care either way.</p>
<p>My hands trembled holding my stapled stack of paper, shakily flipping the pages.</p>
<p>“Glad that’s over,” Lucas said. “Not gonna lie, I only understood about half of the Scarlet Letter. But an A’s an A.”</p>
<p>“I actually really enjoyed it,” said George. “Easy A. How about you Mickey?”</p>
<p>There were no markings on the pages apart from sparse checks. It was either a mistake or a joke.  Maybe my failure was the start of a miracle and my great story.</p>
<p>After the bell rang, instead of following George and Lucas into the hallway, I packed slowly and waited for the class to disperse. Only then did I falter to Mrs. Spring’s desk.</p>
<p>Without looking up, she said, “I presume this is about your grade.”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am, I don’t understand…”</p>
<p>“You forgot to turn in your final draft,” she mumbled whilst scribbling on another sheet, so coldly that goosebumps rose on my arms. “That’s sixty percent of the project grade.”</p>
<p>No, I had turned in my final draft. I didn’t turn in a rough draft. I didn’t think we needed one.</p>
<p>I did what I could to not burst into tears. How childish it might have looked to cry over a bad grade (I was supposed to be angry) but it was my future. It was all I had.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Spring, tell me what I need to do to fix this and I will.”</p>
<p>She shook her head, reaching for her bag to go on lunch break. “One bad grade isn’t going to hurt you.” She was wrong. “You’re still a kid, you have a whole life yet to live.” She didn’t get it. “Let this be a life lesson for you.” She was ruining my life.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Spring, I have been nothing but a good student in your class. Please believe me when I tell you this is my final draft.” I was grasping for threads, hoping she would change my forty percent to sixty percent. I’d end the semester with a C.</p>
<p>She stood and slung her bag over her shoulders. “Even if I did that, your grade still isn’t looking too good.” She headed for the door. I couldn’t let her go. I wanted to leap in front, arms and legs stretched out, to forcefully hold her there until she fixed her mistake. It was an insane thought, but what choice did I have? How desperately did I desire the dream? Is the inability, or the lack of daringness, like a big dream catcher?</p>
<p>“I can work with that!” I blurted. “Without it, I’ll fail.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “Fine, I’ll do that. See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>She walked out the door. Lucas and George peaked back inside. They had heard. Their expressions said it all. George raised one brow, and Lucas might as well have asked <i>didn’t you want something bad to happen to you?</i></p>
<p>What a tragedy indeed Lucas, woe is me! But who should weep for me? No one, really, because it wasn’t a tragedy. It was a mistake that everyone else had already made, and I had gone so long dodging it that I thought I was special and wept in my immature misery at the realization. </p>
<p><i>It’s okay,</i> Lucas would say, <i>we all thought the same at some point.</i></p>
<p>Woe is me, Lucas! Deliver your pity and make me feel alive if that’s what you believe.</p>
<p>I wanted more than a bad day. I wanted to taste a tragedy. A bad grade was no tragedy. It was a mistake that everyone else (except George) had already made. I had dodged it long enough to think myself special for doing so, only to pout at slipping in a meaningless game that everyone else already stopped taking seriously, like I was still hiding while all the seekers moved on, crouched and giggling beneath a stairwell unfound, only to be accidentally caught because someone heard my giggling and who then stood over me bewildered as to why my laughter turned to tears.</p>
<p>Were I to confess my thoughts, laughter would be echoing the halls: “You’re sad that you’re not special? That you’re not better than me? That you think you’ve stooped down and grazed the surface of my level?”</p>
<p>George had lured me into the nastiest of traps, persuading me that people were not equal and leaving me to strut about until someone finally informed me that I was on the wrong end of that spectrum. And because I never deserved to be on the right end nor to believe in it to begin with, I didn’t deserve the right to feel sad losing it. I was an arrogant child worth no sympathy. “Lower your expectations,” they shall say, then dust their hands and walk away.</p>
<p>Let them walk! Why would I ever do that? I loved the sadness—in the same way that those who loved doing nothing with their lives had convinced themselves their complacency was happiness, and that those who renunciate from pleasure tricked a contradictory addiction into their heart deriving pleasure from their renunciation. I loved sadness because it meant there was something in my life I valued: love, hope, happiness. There is no good without evil, tall without short, life without death, and while some say there cannot be sadness without happiness, it was also true there could not be happiness without sadness.</p>
<p>But my sadness was invalidated by those same great commanders and philosophers who deemed my expectations too high. Sadness was reserved for those who dealt with horrors that made them insouciant to their past. I had no more right to be sad than I had right to think myself special; only George held that right.</p>
