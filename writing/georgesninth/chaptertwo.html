								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Two</h1><br>
<p>Under my heavy breath,</p>
<p>Between my beating feet,</p>
<p>Nature tailors the leaves a wrought yellow,</p>
<p>Golden as wheat.</p>
<p>Winnowing winds tear at the bandages,</p>
<p>Separating leaves from their branches,</p>
<p>Speckling the brooks beneath the bridges,</p>
<p>Spilling from atop like aureate avalanches.</p>
<p>As the year matures in September, </p>
<p>Clouds gray the dying sky,</p>
<p>Trees saturate the world orange,</p>
<p>And flowers bloom one last time.</p>
<p>For when, during the last run of September, George told Lucas and I the news: the treatment did not work as it did before. The doctors did not know how to respond to George any better than I. How was he supposed to watch the bomb squad pack up and leave while his mother was still tied to the ticking time bomb? When the doctors are replaced by priests and lawyers and family members he hadn’t met that claimed to have wiped his ass as a baby, how was there any fucking comfort in that?</p>
<p>The only comfort was found in consolation during our run. </p>
<p>Runs represented, in many ways, our escape from the world, since the mind would be too busy motivating itself to push through contrived mud when the real mud of life was still too deep to trudge. In other ways, runs were where we spilled our thoughts or drama in broken sentences between breaths. The beauty was that no one expected a response. Words were heard and judged; replies were reserved or withdrawn. Still, what were Lucas and I supposed to do with that information? It’s not something one can ignore or compartmentalize or even address, so it was simply lodged uncomfortably into our minds–that George was about to be stuck onto the wrong side of a bad story.</p>
<p>“They want to try an experimental therapy,” George spurted. At that moment I believed a miracle would happen as I didn't know a world in which hope ever failed George. Then, he continued, “But it could make things worse. And insurance doesn’t cover it and we can’t afford it, so we don’t even know what to do."</p>
<p>Nothing else was said during the run. We just stuck with our own inclinations–Lucas: listening to his music (and likely brainstorming more intros), George: contemplating his next great thing, and me: attempting poetry that I’d jot down when I got home.</p>
<p>Dinner was slightly quieter that night, one voice removed from the conversation as I twirled my fork around the grilled asparagus on my plate. Dad sat across from me, and each time he eyed me, I’d shuffle another bite down. Not that I wasn’t hungry, nor did I find the food distasteful–despite how often we had it, being Dad’s favorite dish to cook–but I kept looking for moments to divulge to them what had happened.</p>
<p>“The shop is getting quite busy,” Dad said, taking a sip of oaked Chardonnay. “Broken wheels, bent suspension, beaten bumpers. Might go around fixing potholes myself. Would save me time at this rate.”</p>
<p>Mom clinked her fork against her plate at the head of the table. “I’ve seen that one on Baptiste Street knick a few cars myself.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s the perfect trap. A light you can hardly make green, but a road tore up enough to punish anyone that attempts it.”</p>
<p>“Or the exit off the interstate onto Hamilton Road.” Mom lifted a cut of chicken to her mouth and spoke between chews. “I still remember the first time I took it. I about scraped my bumper off on the wall”</p>
<p>“Believe it or not, I’ve seen more cars come in from that speed bump outside the library.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>I found complaining about traffic, or roads in this instance, to be the adult equivalent of the spinning toy one puts above a baby’s cradle. It simply amazed me how a hole in some asphalt would be so fascinating as to trump all other topics of discussion. I looked at Flint, our golden retriever, sitting as dumbfounded as I by my side. I know right? I thought to myself like he could hear me. Between all the joys you see in life and the bewilderment life leaves in me, they complain about potholes.</p>
<p>Flint opened his mouth in agreement.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” Dad said, returning back to the conversation, “I asked my boss if he’d be okay with letting on Mickey to help with the workload. Like an internship or part time job. How would you feel about that Mickey?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly enthusiastic,” I replied, though I had the feeling he wasn’t actually asking for my verdict.</p>
<p>“It’d be good for you,” Mom said, “to see what the real world is like.”</p>
<p>“After school and on the weekends,” Dad clarified, “starting tomorrow morning. Seven-thirty sharp.”</p>
<p>Had he “asked” sooner, I might have been able to spin the conscription into an application essay, but it was at that awkward point between high school and college where it only made my life tremendously more inconvenient. </p>
<p>Yet, was it strange to say I was oddly excited? To do something new with life? Like that first-day-of-school excitement we would have as kids after a long, eventless summer. Excited to see what being in the next grade was like and if you’d sit next to your friends and if there would be any new cute girls from out-of-state–all while loathing the preponderance of what else was brought with the new year. That was how I felt with Dad’s proposition: excited to have that experience of earning money and toiling with cars and bantering with coworkers and the general sense of growing up despite it being the universal fear of my generation.</p>
<p>“Scared of vegetables again?” Mom asked, noticing I had zoned out.</p>
<p>“What? No Mom, I’m not five.”</p>
<p>“The way you’ve dizzied them in a spiral says otherwise.”</p>
<p>She’d always say something silly like that, anthropomorphizing them when, as a child, I would always wait as long as possible before having to chew into them.</p>
<p>“There’s just something I want to talk to you guys about.”</p>
<p>“Why wait?” My father asked from across the table.”This is the time we’re supposed to talk about these things.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because I didn’t want to interrupt their beguiling dialogue on the Baptiste Street pothole, but really it was because it was a topic I didn’t want to bring up without a means of exit. I didn’t want to be stuck at the table waiting for dinner to be over, marinating in my failure to persuade them. So I simply said, “It’s not something I want to discuss with a stick of asparagus sticking out of my mouth.”</p>
<p>Without a second thought, Dad finished his last piece of chicken, screeched his chair back, and started collecting plates. Mom wasn’t too happy as she wasn’t quite finished, but Dad didn’t care and forced everyone to go along. So she stacked the cups and I collected the silverware. Dad dumped the remains into the trash can (and some onto the floor for Flint), I rinsed the dishes, and Mom loaded them into the dishwasher. </p>
<p>It was almost eerie in a way because nobody said anything, and there was this unspoken tension Mom had towards Dad, and this uncomfortable persistence by Dad to be my dad, and this apprehension of mine to speak to Mom and Dad yet too busy with my hands to prepare the least perilous sentence. I wasn’t scared to speak to my parents on touchy subjects or even stand up for myself when I needed to. I had no expectations about what my parents were to say in response to what I was about to ask; however, I had expectations about who my parents were and hoped they lived up to them and feared they wouldn’t.</p>
<p>Once the dishwasher was set and stirring in the background, we sat back down at the table.</p>
<p>“So what is it you want to discuss?” Dad asked.</p>
<p>By then, I decided it would be best to lay it out in bare, plain, simple words. “Well, as you know, George’s mother got cancer again…” The words immediately tasted sour coming out of my mouth. It was not my story and it was not my story to tell yet I felt like I was actively injecting myself into it. I swallowed and continued, “But the therapy did not work like it did before.”</p>
<p>Mom touched my clasped hands. “Oh, I’m sorry honey.”</p>
<p>I went on, wanting to spill it out onto the table. “The doctors recommended a new experimental therapy, but insurance doesn’t cover experimental therapy. Which means they would need to pay for it themselves, and they have already spent their funds on the previous medical bills and during covid when they got furloughed.”</p>
<p>I waited for a response. Only silence. I took a deep breath. “So I was wondering if you could help pay for it.”</p>
<p>My mother eyed my father and turned back to me. “Oh, we don’t really have the money for that either. Between all the bills and financial struggles with covid too…”</p>
<p>“Mom,” I interrupted, “you drive a car that would pay their medical bills three times over.” </p>
<p>I had not intended to spell it out in an immediate affront, but her pretense was palpable, as she sat in a ten thousand dollar suit with a ten thousand dollar watch casually drinking hundred-dollar wine–a prodigal lifestyle even for her.</p>
<p>My words had irked her. “And I have yet to pay them off, don’t I? Mickey, it’s not like we can start selling our belongings everytime someone needs help. We would never have anything.”</p>
<p>“Elizabeth,” Dad said, “we should at least think it over.”</p>
<p>She shot him a stare that shut him up.</p>
<p>They had the money, I knew that. Or rather, my mom did. She was an executive. My dad was just a mechanic and he only kept his job out of some bygone definition of manhood. Even if he only made a fraction of my mother, he did not want to stay at home all day.</p>
<p>Still, Mom did not get to where she is today by playing nice. I was old enough now to realize she stepped on a few people on the way up. With people she knew, she was the sweetest person you’d know, but she would also cut you off in traffic without a second look if you hid behind a tinted windshield that made you more car than human in her eyes. If you were just another name, tough luck. That’s what George’s mother was to her. She didn’t know her and asking for tens of thousands of dollars from someone who knew someone who knew her son who knew her meant red flags flew. Was this right to ask of her?</p>
<p>I began to regret the direction I took the conversation and attempted to turn it around. “But this is George. I’ve known him my whole life and his mother has always been so sweet to me. Even a little help would go a long way.”</p>
<p>“Mickey, we’re done,” she said, getting up and turning away. “We’re not talking about this anymore.”</p>
<p>“But Mom…”</p>
<p>“We’re done.”</p>
<p>Any further pleading was pointless. My lack of restraint had cost me my hope. George would have to find his miracle elsewhere. </p>
<p>I looked to my father who showed no expression, but I could see he at least wanted to help, although I couldn’t tell if he only wanted to help me or help George too. He waited until Mom had left the room before saying anything.</p>
<p>“You’re disappointed?” my father asked.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed.”</p>
<p>He clasped his hands and sighed as fathers do before trying to explain something difficult. “There are a lot of things in life I wish I could solve. Things I wish I could throw some amount of money at and let it disappear. Things I wish I could help someone through but knew that no matter what I said or did they’d still struggle with it. But not all battles are ours, and that’s a good thing because we all have our fair share.”</p>
<p>Except you could throw money at it and solve the issue.</p>
<p>It seemed so backwards in a country so privileged where insurance, of all things, was one of the sole requirements, that the same privilege of overwhelming societal wealth in an overly-industrial world did not extend to life or death in this case; that the requirement was for financial wellbeing while mental wellbeing was merely optional depending on how much of a sacrifice one could make; that as a society we only hold the expenses of each other’s foolish mistakes responsible and leave the destruction of mother nature to the lone soul who was chosen from her raffle; that the exceptional cases where one would expect insurance to play its role–those lives were left to the lottery of online platforms and the charity of others.</p>
<p>So, yes, my hopes were that my parents would participate in this society where charity was part of the unspoken deal, much like I hoped they’d vote and drive considerately and treat thy neighbor like thyself. Maybe I was asking for too much. At least one of them never fucking risked killing someone so he’d only be four minutes late to work instead of seven, but that’s about all I got.</p>
<p>“You’re acting like you don’t even know George.”</p>
<p>“I know George enough to know that they didn’t ask you to help, did they?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t ask me to help, no.”</p>
<p>“Then they will find a way, I promise you. Loans, selling a car, something. Every family deals with things like this and it’s not always our place to inject ourselves into it. I’m not saying don’t help your friends. But don’t be disappointed when others don’t solve your problems for you. There’s more than enough problems in this world to go around and you’ll deal with more than you can take on yourself.”</p>
<p>That was the difference between me and my parents at that moment: they believed in a world where everyone equally had problems they had to solve on their own; I believed in a world where we could take on each other’s problems in ways that would be more impactful than taking them on alone.</p>
<p>I stood from the table and headed to the stairs–my means of exit–when I saw Flint sitting in the archway, hoping to catch additional remains of dinner after chasing Mom out of the kitchen. He reminded me of that kitten George cradled in his arms. In that picture in my memory, George was happy in a way I had not seen since that day. I could not help but turn around and vent my disappointment.</p>
<p>“You know, George has been my friend longer than I can recall. His family took care of me when I didn’t ask for help. They would feed me dinner after our run before knowing I’d come over here and eat too, just because they wanted to be nice. They would drive me to competitions when you or Mom were too busy to do it yourselves. They were there when you weren’t or when I was too scared to confide things in you because I didn’t think you’d care. They fucking did your job for you and you two won’t think twice about sharing what you don’t need.”</p>
<p>“And yes, Dad, I get that most of this is Mom’s money, and that ‘happy wife happy life’ bullshit, and I know that you’re the one sitting here listening to me, and I know that they will probably get through it on their own, and I know that my request was uncalled for and I have no right asking these things of you two, but I love George to death and I know that if the day comes where this turns him and his family into people who have given up on the world when you could have been there, no matter how wrong I am to expect anything out of you and no matter how little you might have actually been able to help, I just won’t be able to see you the same way.”</p>
<p>And I know that hurt him, and it hurt me knowing that it hurt him, but I wanted to at least do my job as a son and share with him what was true. His fatherhood instincts would just have to kick in and understand that his son won’t always be happy with him for reasons that would hopefully grow old as time moved on.</p>
<p>I turned back to Flint and grazed my hand across his furry head as I made my way to the stairs.</p>
