								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Two</h1><br>
<p>During the last run of September, George told Lucas and I the news: the treatment did not work as it did before. </p>
<p>The doctors did not know how to respond to George any better than I. How was he supposed to watch the bomb squad pack up and leave while his mother was still tied to the ticking time bomb? When the doctors are replaced by priests and lawyers, where was there any comfort?</p>
<p>During our last run of September, George had decided.</p>
<p>Runs were our escape from the world. For me, it was an escape from monotony. It was a form of play that engulfed me in a state of being I longed to keep. For George, on the other hand, it was a distraction to push through self-imposed obstacles when the real mud of life was still too deep to trudge.</p>
<p>Runs were where we spilled our thoughts and drama in broken sentences between beaths. Every syllable stung to speak, so only those that were worth speaking were spoken. Confessions were heard and judged, but unwarranted replies were reserved and withdrawn. </p>
<p>Still, what was to be done with the information thrust forth by George? We couldn’t ignore or compartmentalize or address it, so it remained uncomfortably lodged into our minds—George was to be stuck on the wrong side of a bad story. But I never doubted that a miracle would ensue. I did not know a world in which hope failed George.</p>
<p>“They suggested an experimental therapy,” George spurted, “though it could make things worse. And insurance doesn’t cover it and we can’t afford it, so we don’t know what to do."</p>
<p>I couldn’t blame George for sharing the last part with me and Lucas. We were his best friends, of course, but we were wealthy best friends and his mother’s life was on the line. None of us were oblivious to the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>Thus, George’s next big story was well underway. What a miracle! How joyful that family would be after weathering the storm! That every day henceforth would be a day to them a true gift of life undeserved, while the rest of us quibble about and curse our parents for their stingy rules, only to have our realization too late when we are grown and moved far away, that only the story of death could reconcile our disputes.</p>
<p>Dinner was slightly quieter that night, one voice removed from the conversation as I twirled my fork around the grilled asparagus on my plate. Dad sat across from me, and each time he eyed me, I’d shuffle another bite down. Not that I wasn’t hungry, nor did I find the food distasteful–despite how often we had it, being Dad’s favorite dish to cook–but I kept looking for moments to divulge to them what had happened.</p>
<p>“The shop is getting quite busy,” Dad said, taking a sip of oaked Chardonnay. “Broken wheels, bent suspension, beaten bumpers. Might go around fixing potholes myself. Would save me time at this rate.”</p>
<p>Mom clinked her fork against her plate at the head of the table. “I’ve seen that one on Baptiste Street knick a few cars myself.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s the perfect trap. A light you can hardly make green, but a road tore up enough to punish anyone that attempts it.”</p>
<p>“Or the exit off the interstate onto Hamilton Road.” Mom lifted a cut of chicken to her mouth and spoke between chews. “I still remember the first time I took it. I about scraped my bumper off on the wall.”</p>
<p>“Believe it or not,” Dad said, “I’ve seen more cars come in from that speed bump outside the library.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>Complaining about traffic and road infrastructure was the adult equivalent of spinning a toy above a baby’s cradle. It never failed to amaze them. I looked to Flint, our golden retriever, sitting as dumbfounded as I by my side. Between the joys and bewilderments of life, they complain about potholes? How pathetic.</p>
<p>Flint panted in agreement.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” Dad said, “I asked my boss if he’d be okay with letting on Mickey to help with the workload. Like an internship or part time job. How would you feel about that Mickey?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly enthusiastic,” I replied, though I doubted he was actually asking for my verdict.</p>
<p>“It’d be good for you,” Mom said, “to see what the real world is like.”</p>
<p>“After school and on the weekends,” Dad clarified, “starting tomorrow morning. Seven-thirty sharp.”</p>
<p>Had he asked sooner, I might have been able to spin the conscription into an application essay, but it was at that awkward point between high school and college where it only made my life tremendously more inconvenient. Yet, was it strange to say I was oddly excited? To do something new with life? Like that first-day-of-school excitement we would have as kids after a long, eventless summer. Excited to see what being in the next grade was like and what teachers you’d have and if you’d get to sit next to your friends and if there would be any new cute girls from out-of-state–all while loathing the preponderance of what else was brought with the new year. </p>
<p>“Scared of vegetables again?” Mom asked, noticing I had zoned out.</p>
<p>“What? No Mom, I’m not five.”</p>
<p>“The way you’ve dizzied them in a spiral says otherwise.”</p>
<p>She used to say something silly like that, anthropomorphizing them when, as a child, I would always wait as long as possible before having to chew into them. “There’s just something I want to talk to you guys about.”</p>
<p>“Why wait?” Dad asked. “This is the time we’re supposed to talk about these things.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because I didn’t want to interrupt their beguiling dialogue on the Baptiste Street pothole, but it was a topic I didn’t want to bring up without a means of exit. I didn’t want to be stuck at the table waiting for dinner to be over, marinating in my failure to persuade them. So I simply said, “It’s not something I want to discuss with a stick of asparagus sticking out of my mouth.”</p>
<p>Without a second thought, Dad finished his last piece of chicken, screeched his chair back, and started collecting plates. Mom wasn’t happy as she wasn’t finished, but Dad didn’t care and forced everyone to go along. So she stacked the cups and I collected the silverware. Dad dumped the remains between the trashcan and Flint’s bowl, I rinsed the dishes, and Mom loaded them into the dishwasher.</p>
<p>It was eerie in a way because nobody said anything, and there was an unspoken tension Mom had towards Dad, and an uncomfortable persistence by Dad to be my dad, and an apprehension of mine to speak to Mom and Dad yet too busy with my hands to prepare the least perilous sentence. I was not scared to speak to my parents on delicate subjects or stand up for myself when I needed to, nor had I any expectations about what my parents were to say in response to what I was to ask; however, I had expectations about who my parents were, hoped they lived up to them, and feared they would not.</p>
<p>Once the dishwasher was set and stirring in the background, we sat back down at the table.</p>
<p>“So what is it you want to discuss?” Dad asked.</p>
<p>By then, I decided it would be best to say it plainly. “Well, as you know, George’s mother got cancer again.” The words immediately tasted sour coming out of my mouth. It was not my story and it was not my story to tell yet I was actively injecting myself into it. I swallowed and continued, “But the therapy did not work like it did before.”</p>
<p>Mom touched my clasped hands. “I’m sorry honey.”</p>
<p>I went on, “The doctors recommended a new experimental therapy, but insurance doesn’t cover experimental therapy. Which means they would need to pay for it themselves, and they have already spent their funds on the previous medical bills and during covid when they got furloughed.”</p>
<p>I waited for a response. Only silence. I took a deep breath. “I was wondering if you could help pay for it.”</p>
<p>My mother eyed my father and turned back to me. “Oh, we don’t really have the money for that. Between all the bills and financial struggles with covid too—”</p>
<p>Her pretense was palpable, as she sat in a ten thousand dollar suit with a ten thousand dollar watch casually drinking hundred-dollar wine whilst preaching she had nothing to spare my friend.</p>
<p>“Mom, you drive a car that would pay their medical bills twice over.”</p>
<p>“And I have yet to pay them off,” she said. “It’s not like we can sell our belongings every time someone needs help. We would never have anything.”</p>
<p>“Elizabeth,” Dad said, “we should at least think it over.”</p>
<p>She shot him a stare that shut him up.</p>
<p>Kindness was not what lifted Mom to her position. I was old enough to realize the small steps she made on the way up were off the backs of others. Face-to-face, she was the sweetest person you’d know, but conversation was as far as her kindness extended. However, was it kindness giving tens of thousands of dollars to someone who knew someone who knew her son, or was it benevolence? A trait too extreme to expect of anyone?</p>
<p>I could have scolded her or nodded in understanding, but neither of those were going to get George the money he needed. “This is George. I’ve known him my whole life and his mother has always been extremely sweet to me. Even a little help would go a long way.”</p>
<p>“Mickey, we’re done,” she said, getting up and turning away. “We’re not talking about this anymore.”</p>
<p>“But Mom—”</p>
<p>“We’re done.”</p>
<p>George would have to find his miracle elsewhere.</p>
<p>I was not angry. I was confused. Never had I expected my mother to react so indignantly. It was like I was a child who disobeyed her strict, non-negotiable rules, a problem that plagued my early childhood. Rules that I understood, I had no qualms. But rules that were not explained to me, and seemed to arise out of power? Those because-I-said-so rules? How dare anyone impose those on me. As I got older, I began to understand the rules, that most of them made sense but Mom was unable to explain because she didn’t feel the obligation to do so. I was her son. I was to obey. I knew my request was excessive, but did money truly mean more than another’s life to her?</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I questioned what money meant to people. The comfort it bought, the fragile insecurities it relieved, the meaning that the pursuit of it brought, and in that, how people placed money above even self. But even more than that—what void would be opened up in their lives if money suddenly became meaningless to them? Would their meaning in life evaporate too? Did Mom blind herself to the situation to spare herself that trouble?</p>
<p>I looked to my father who showed no expression. He wanted to help, although I wasn’t sure if he wanted to help me or help George’s mother. He waited until Mom left the room to speak. </p>
<p>“You’re disappointed?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed.”</p>
<p>He clasped his hands and sighed as fathers do before trying to explain something difficult. “There are a lot of things in life I wish I could solve. Things I wish I could throw some amount of money at and let it disappear. Things I wish I could help someone through but knew that no matter what I said or did they’d still struggle with it. But not all battles are ours.”</p>
<p>“You’re acting like you don’t even know George,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know George enough to know that they didn’t ask you to help, did they?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t ask me to help, no.”</p>
<p>“Then they will find a way,” he said, “I promise you. Loans, selling a car, something. Every family deals with problems like this and it’s not always our place to inject ourselves into it. I’m not saying don’t help your friends. But don’t be disappointed when others don’t solve your problems for you. There’s more than enough problems in this world to go around and you’ll deal with more than you can take on yourself.”</p>
<p>I stood from the table and took my means of exit when I saw Flint sitting in the archway, hoping to catch additional remains of dinner having just chased after Mom. He reminded me of the kitten George cradled in his arms. In that picture in my memory, George was happy in a way I had not seen since. My best friend was waiting for his miracle, and I failed to provide it. I could not help but turn around and vent my disappointment.</p>
<p>“George has been my friend longer than I can recall. His family took care of me when I didn’t ask for help. They would feed me dinner after our run before knowing I’d come over here and eat too, just because they wanted to be nice. They would drive me to competitions when you or Mom were too busy to do it yourselves. They were there when you weren’t or when I was too scared to confide things in you because I didn’t think you’d care. They did your job for you and you two won’t think twice about sharing what you don’t need.</p>
<p>“And yes, Dad, I get that most of this is Mom’s money, and ‘happy wife happy life’, and I know that you’re the one sitting here listening to me, and I know that they will probably get through it on their own, and I know that my request was uncalled for and that I have no right asking these things of you two, but I love George to death and I know that if the day comes where this turns him and his family into people who have given up on the world when you could have been there, no matter how wrong I am to expect anything out of you and no matter how little you might have actually been able to help, I won’t be able to see you the same way.”</p>
<p>I know that hurt him, and it hurt me knowing that it hurt him, but I wanted to do my job as a son and share with him what was true. His fatherhood instincts would have to kick in and understand that his son won’t always be happy with him for reasons that would hopefully grow old as time moved on.</p>
<p>I turned back to Flint and grazed my hand across his furry head as I made my way to the stairs.</p>
