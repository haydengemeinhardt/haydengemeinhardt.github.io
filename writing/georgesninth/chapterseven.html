<p>Between the news cameras and police reports, apathy quickly consumed me in place of the fleeting wave of grief. All it was to them was paychecks and formalities. It was as inevitable as the sizzling of eggs under a rising sun. It was an entire community coming together to remind me that my situation was the most normal thing of my life compared to everyone else that existed before me. It was only as comforting as lying on hot asphalt after a long run, but it did lighten my suffocating heart.</p>
<p>There wasn’t anything left for me and Lucas to do at the bridge after talking to the police, so we just finished the run in silence then parted ways.</p>
<p>My house was dark. Neither Mom nor Dad nor Flint were home. It was just dead and cold and spacious. I felt lonely and depressed, and ultimately nothing at all. Not even the cold sting of the shower brought anything out of me.</p>
<p>I just thought of George and his family. How the world decided to treat the Lebedevs. If the world had even bothered to let the rest of the family know what they did to them.</p>
<p>I worried dearly about her. I tried calling her and got no response, which meant either the show was so good that it stripped her of her electronic connection to the world, or she ignored me in the mess of things.</p>
<p>So I threw on my clothes from earlier–a black long sleeve shirt and jeans–and drove down to the hospital. I was still awfully tired. I dozed in and out of driving, jerking awake each time my car veered near the edge only to think about the man who did the same with George and I thought myself to be a shameful man but felt nothing at all.</p>
<p>I dragged myself into the waiting room of the emergency wing. Jenny was no where in sight. I cluelessly approached a counter where a nurse or secretary or some worker sat behind and asked about George.</p>
<p>“Are you related to him?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No,” I replied, “but I’ve known him my whole life.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I can’t disclose any information.”</p>
<p>So I did what George would have done from the start. “I actually am related to him.”</p>
<p>She looked sternly at me. “Then let me see your driver’s license.”</p>
<p>Why was she so keen on keeping two dear friends apart? </p>
<p>I showed her my license out of pure spite. When she denied me once again, I snagged it back and made my way past the desk to the door where a stretcher was hastily wheeled in. But the nurse called out and a security guard promptly escorted me outside.</p>
<p>I slumped onto a bench, not knowing what to do. I stared at the stars and eventually laid down and stared straight at them.</p>
<p>Sometime later, for the second time that day, a hand rustled my hair. I woke to see Jenny. Her face was red and wet. Her hair was a mess. I rose and embraced her without hesitation. She wrapped her arms around me and grabbed the back of my shirt, drying her face along my shoulder and neck.</p>
<p>It was my fault that I fell asleep at work, as we could have gone home sooner had I done my share of the work. It was my fault that we ran under moonlight instead of streetlights because I was scared to see my mom’s car in the wrong driveway. It was my fault that she would be in the driveway that night anyway. It was my fault I couldn’t keep up with George and run alongside him. It was my fault I didn’t jump in after him as Lucas had instinctively done. It was my fault I didn’t gravely search and find George sooner. It was my fault that I couldn’t swim well and pull George to shore faster. It was, in all practicalities, my fault that any of this ever happened.</p>
<p> A voice in my head cried Behold, your dream! All my wishes were granted and all my feelings were validated.</p>
<p>In our hug, I asked softly so as to not upset her any further, “Have you seen him yet?</p>
<p>After a few moments, she pulled back and replied, “He’s not him anymore.”</p>
<p>I was hesitant to pry further and ask for permission to see him. But I still felt it to be a right of mine. I wanted to see what the story reaped. And I just wanted to see my friend.</p>
<p>She continued to explain what the doctors had said, in between sniffs and spurts, that George was in a vegetative state, and even if he came out of it, he would be paralyzed neck-down and with limited mental capacity. I told her I still wanted to see him, and so she led me to the room where only one visitor was allowed at a time—a strange rule to protect someone no longer conscious.</p>
<p>On the hospital bed laid the body of George with tubes and wires strung about, keeping it alive as stubborn as it was. But there comes a point when even the most stubborn of a person cannot deny reality for reality doesn’t wait for anyone to accept it. George probably came to this realization as he was paralyzed, face-down in the water. He was too much for the world and it had finally worked up the courage to rid itself of him. Now his body was like one whose spirited soul was ripped out of it so that he merely existed as he was always meant to merely do.</p>
<p>Knowing George, he lived his story in its never-ending climax all the way through the very last page. His story was priceless to me. Him allowing me to be there in the end was his final parting gift such that I may too have a story to tell. It was his handing down of a kingdom.</p>
<p>I put my hand to his shoulder. “Thank you, George. For everything. I always thought we would part ways at graduation, and that I would tell you this then, but I waited too long. Even now I feel like you live more of a life than I, but I’m done waiting. I should like to tell you that I won’t fail again.” It was all much harder to speak to him my thoughts aloud than to simply think them. “One day, I’ll see you on the other side. I hope you wait for me there.”</p>
<p>I wept once more, dried my tears, and returned to Jenny. She sat with her arms wrapped around her tucked knees in a chair right outside the door. Of the family, it was just her.</p>
<p>Mr. Lebedev was hundreds of miles away with Mrs. Lebedeva anxiously awaiting the results of the surgery tomorrow. He couldn’t get back for some time even if he caught the first plane out in the morning. Should he? The world had simultaneously split him—be with his wife in her possible final days or return to deal with the death of his son. No father should ever have to choose like that. And no mother should be on her death bed only to hear she outlived her son.</p>
<p>“Do you want to stay here?” I asked Jenny.</p>
<p>“Where else is there to go?”</p>
<p>Her alone at home would not be good, nor would her sitting alone next to George all night be any better despite what people often did. In other words, picturing her sad and alone left me sorrowful, but I wouldn’t be allowed to stay with her here.</p>
<p>“Come stay at my house for the night, and sleep in the guest room. Not next to a dusty vending machine.”</p>
<p>Only in the absurdity of it all did such a proposition slip out. But that is what I wanted for us. If there was one thing I learned from George, it was that if he wanted to do something, he would have done it unless he had a really good reason not to. I could not promise George that I would live as he had and then walk out the door and not live as he had.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel like moving,” she groaned. “I don’t feel like doing anything.”</p>
<p>So I sat down next to her, cradled her in my arms and picked her up, then carried her down the hall.</p>
<p>I would never have done this before. But if I couldn’t even do such a bold thing as George would do, now, after he gave me all the motivation he could to do so, then I would never do it again. If I couldn’t do it now, then there was no right for me to expect a future where I would, or deserve a future where I would. Which meant that even if this failed, and she screamed and wailed and never talked to me again and watched me be escorted out by security and banned from the hospital, it didn’t matter. What mattered was here, now, that I had the discipline not to be a hypocritical, shameful person. George’s gun was now forever pressed to my temple. There was no longer any time to push things off. No time to wait on the world to give me the perfect opportunity. The world from my eyes was no longer George’s world. It had to be mine.</p>
<p>Jenny didn’t flinch. She didn’t do any of those things. She just continued her lifeless pose and rested her head on my chest.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Had I not taken the nap in the hospital or had Jenny in the car with me, I surely would have crashed on my way home.</p>
<p>My dad’s truck was finally parked in the driveway, but the house was still dark and asleep. I quietly carried Jenny up the stairs into the guest bedroom as she laid half asleep in my arms like a child.</p>
<p>The room was chilly--the nighttime temperature my parents liked to keep the house at night—and the floor was illuminated by the moonlight. I laid Jenny comfortably on the bed and sat back onto the windowsill, staring out over the peaks of the trees and down below with all its high-rises and bridges and streetlights. Cars zipped through the streets, planes blinked in the sky, and boats waded by docks. Some of those were sports cars, private jets, and yachts. I never could have hated a place so much.</p>
<p>It wasn’t jealousy. I had the same stuff. It wasn’t undue contemptuousness either. Take a single one of those needlessly luxurious things and a beloved family would not have fallen apart. Take all those things as a whole, and maybe the city wouldn’t need to split itself.</p>
<p>Hell, what was the difference between a one hundred thousand dollar car and a two hundred thousand dollar car? A smoother engine? Exotic leather seats? Did people seriously, in full heart and complete contemplation, think these things to be worth more to them than literally saving someone’s life? Either they were truly heartless, or they were consumed by the complacency of leaving their brain on autopilot.</p>
<p>I previously thought myself to be better than them all in these regards. What happened earlier proved otherwise—even I succumbed to placing a façade over the world to ignore what transpired around me. If I couldn’t do it, how could I expect the world to do any better? This whole world was dreadful—every nook and cranny to my very own soul deserved condemnation.</p>
<p>The bed creaked. Jenny tugged a thick blanket off of it and dragged it to the windowsill. She climbed into the nook across from me then tossed the blanket up in the air over us. As the blanket fell, our eyes caught sight of each other and she smiled faintly.</p>
<p>It was as if she came to show me that she was still unadulterated and good. That not all parts of the world were bad. But they were the parts that were out of reach and not to be loved by me.</p>
<p>We sat with our backs to the wall and our knees curled up, much like our breaks at the garage. At some point in the silence, we drifted into sleep with our legs entangled beneath the blanket.</p>
