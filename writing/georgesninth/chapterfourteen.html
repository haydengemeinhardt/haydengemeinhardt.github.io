<p>How could I forget?</p>
<p>“Remember, test on Monday!” Mrs. Rupert yelled at us as we squeezed out of class on Friday.</p>
<p>It was Monday. Four stapled papers sat on my desk just like she promised. I thumbed through them. They were filled front and back with questions. Some were multiple choice, most were written, and I was only faintly familiar with what was being asked. The more pages I flipped, the more my hands shook, before dropping it entirely and running my fingers through my hair. </p>
<p>Others were already obnoxiously flipping and creasing so everyone heard they finished the front in record time, like Lucas who sat at his desk next to mine. He zipped through the pages, filling in answers like he was checking boxes on paperwork in the doctor’s office. Chest pain? No. Trouble breathing? No. Family history of high blood pressure? No. One would’ve thought he invented the chemical nomenclature himself.</p>
<p>I spent the next half hour answering what questions I could. As I tried solving the problems, the tricks would show themselves and I’d be able to answer what I thought I wouldn’t, but there were only so many questions I could skip. At the end, I tallied up my points. Best case scenario was a D. Surely no one had ever gotten into Valencia with a D! It was unfair! I showed up to every single class. I took notes and paid attention. I did all of the homework. I had merely forgotten to study the weekend before. </p>
<p>I thought maybe I could explain myself and ask for a re-exam, but I also already heard her saying: “if you actually paid attention, you wouldn’t have needed to study.” as if memorization wasn’t the name of a closed-book exam. Meanwhile, an entirely different solution rested in my pocket. It was forbidden out of respect for others and with due punishment if I got caught crossing that boundary. But the punishment was meaningless–whether I got caught or forgoed cheating, I would fail, and any hope of getting into Valencia was lost. Could I willingly let a small misstep strip me of my future in the name of virtue—that tenuous concept whose meaning changed with each passing day? Like proposing to someone I had only just met? It was an absurd proposal. </p>
<p>The clock was ticking, and failure was not an option. There was no more time left to deliberate how best to dodge the truck barrelling forth. The only option was to take the best path and follow it or risk not having a path to choose at all. It was not shooting myself in the foot but stabbing my own back. I spent months criticizing others' lack of virtue only to cast aside my own at the first sight of my lifelong dream in peril, even if that dream was already lost! When push came to shove, when the gun was pointed at my head, when the earth shook and the tsunami was soon to come, the me who was meticulously carved throughout the years would remain, not the me haphazardly molded atop that foundation overnight with the soft clay revealed by the retreating water, still yet to be baked and hardened by the sun. </p>
<p>Everyone was buried too deep within their own tests to notice me. Mrs. Rupert, on the other hand, was diligently patrolling the array of desks. She stopped at the front periodically to glare over the class, hunting and sniffing out a cheater, then crept the aisle which smelled most suspicious. I took a deep breath and slid my phone from my pocket and set it on my chair between my thighs. Then I began from the shortest question that was easiest to discreetly type with one finger.</p>
<p>I would type when Mrs. Rupert was walking away and then write the answer when she turned back. It was difficult typing while trying not to appear I was not doing so. It was even more difficult with my phone stashed between my thighs. Sometimes the seam of my jeans would be in the way of the letters on the edge, those tricky a’s, o’s, p’s, and l’s. Sometimes I'd accidentally hit the spacebar and the unfinished word would be autocorrected away. Sometimes I wouldn’t be able to read the answer in time and be forced to idly pretend I was thinking with my hand in my lap while Mrs. Rupert roamed at the front.</p>
<p>Still, after thirty persistent minutes, most of the test was answered. I could have stopped–I should have–but those thirty minutes were like heroin. My hands no longer shook from fear of failing. They shook from the adrenaline of getting away with murder in broad daylight. I never knew such a thrill existed, and it would’ve been best I kept it that way, for I no longer cheated out of necessity but out of greed.</p>
<p>I only had five questions left. I checked the clock behind me, beneath which Mrs. Rupert stood with crossed arms. Ten minutes until the bell. The race was on!</p>
<p>My finger typed with more experience in the trenches of the chair with my thighs optimally parted to show enough of the screen without giving myself away. My other hand wrote the same words and equations it was familiar with writing in the homework. Soon one question was down, then two. I checked back over my shoulder. Six minutes remained. Mrs. Rupert began down an aisle on the other side of the room. I typed in the next question, a rather long one, but quickly, and wrote down the answer. Mrs. Rupert turned down my aisle, out of all aisles! I stuffed my hand in my lap to hide the phone and stared at the test until she passed. One question remained.</p>
<p>My heart raced, and with it, my hands began to sweat and smear letters on the screen. I dried my fingers on my jeans and retyped the question with clenched teeth. There was no time to be cautious. I smashed the letters without care of checking for Mrs. Rupert. I entered my search, clicked on the first forum, scrolled down to the comments, transferred the work to my sheet, then set down my pencil and closed the gap between my thighs to hide my phone.</p>
<p>“Time’s up,” Mrs. Rupert called. “Please hand in your tests and have a nice rest of your day.”</p>
<p>The bell rang. The class filled with chatter of both relief and disappointment. Everyone rose to leave. Even though a wall of people separated me from Mrs. Rupert, I did not want anyone to know what I had done. I couldn’t lean and pull my elbow back to put my phone away. My pockets were too tight to do it subtly. Instead, I slipped my phone into the inside pocket of my jacket that I had draped over the back of my chair. Then I rose, I collected my test and pencil, put on my backpack, and slung my jacket over my arm. I turned in my test and left the classroom gleaming.</p>
<p>Lucas was waiting in the hallway, bewildered and bug-eyed, and stopped me in my tracks. I returned to him the same expressions, wondering how someone who breezed through an exam could be so upset.</p>
<p>“Cheating?” he spat. “Really?”</p>
<p>“I was going to fail!” I exclaimed in a stage whisper. “What was I supposed to do? Turn in a half blank test?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t know, study? Lucas said.” “That test is curved, you know. You’re screwing everyone else over–”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, did you need something?”</p>
<p>Lucas wrapped his arm around me and led me outside through the doors next to the classroom. Cold air rushed past us inside, then the door thumped closed. We stopped at the edge of the entrance’s alcove, out of proximity of prying ears and out of reach of the wet blanket of gray clouds who shed their excess weight.</p>
<p>“Don’t do this,” Lucas said. “Seriously, what’s this about?”</p>
<p>“I was just in my head all weekend after the party,” I replied. “The test slipped my mind”</p>
<p>“I get that, but why didn’t you just turn in what you had?”</p>
<p>“And delete all of my college applications?”</p>
<p>Lucas thrusted both his hands into his hair as if he were to pull it out. “Holy shit dude, move on!”</p>
<p>“I know I should but I can’t! Not until that rejection comes. I can’t face it.”</p>
<p>Lucas groaned as he let his palms rub across his eyes until his fingers formed a mask. </p>
<p> “Don’t you remember the need?” I asked. “Our old god? You used to feel the same. Now you couldn’t care less. How does that loss not suffocate you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Lucas said. “How does it make you more passionate? Why doesn’t losing something you care about numb you to the point of letting it go?” In my silence, he sighed. “I like to think I made the decision to move on because it was best for me. I also think you decided that letting it fuel your ambition was the best choice for you. I don’t know if we made different decisions simply because we had different friends on the streets we grew up on or because we listened to different music or played different games, but whatever your reason, it doesn’t mean the rest of us will give you free passes to walk over us.”</p>
<p>“I can’t say I made that decision anymore than I made the decision to like running. I only made the decision to act on it. You, on the other hand–I get that your past affects your decisions, but the future is undecided. Why doesn’t that opportunity impact your decisions so much more?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Lucas said.</p>
<p>“Why throw your life away because of your past?”</p>
<p>“Who are you to come to me and say I am throwing away my life? After how you’ve acted the last few weeks? You’re ridiculous,” Lucas scoffed.</p>
<p>I opened my mouth and paused. “I made the decision to pick myself back up when I saw that undecided future. Hugo reminded me of it. I just wish I knew how so I could remind you too.”</p>
<p>“So you think you got it all figured out because Hugo whispered real gently in your ear.” Lucas shook his head. “I get that you want me to join in on your little game, but that’s too bad. I see my life being much happier this way.”</p>
<p>“How?” I snapped.</p>
<p>“I told you, I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“How is doing nothing with your life a happy life?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know!” Lucas yelled. “How do you know that throwing caution to the wind is a happy life?”</p>
<p>“Because I witnessed a living, walking version of it, and I wanted nothing more than to be like that too.”</p>
<p>“Oh, George had a sad life!”</p>
<p>“He was the happiest person I knew.”</p>
<p>“Then you didn’t know him at all.”</p>
<p>“I knew him better than anyone else did!”</p>
<p>“Look, I’ve told you I wanted to heal. I want to have a normal life and I would like you to be a part of it, but I can’t have both if you can’t move on.”</p>
<p>“So what’s it going to be then?”</p>
<p>Lucas rolled his eyes. “You piss me off sometimes, you know that?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember that day when we were running with George, except we had left him stumbling behind? And you said never again? I would have never left you behind, even if I had to drag you to the finish line myself. That’s what friends do, that’s what teammates do, that’s what brothers do. But that’s not what you did.”</p>
<p>“Fuck you, dude,” Lucas spat. “You want to have your stories? Fine! But don’t talk to me until you’ve grown up.”  Lucas shoulder-pushed past me and stormed inside.</p>
<p>“So that’s it?” I called.</p>
<p>“Let me know if you get any revelations!” Lucas shouted, letting the door thump shut behind him.</p>
<p>I followed the covered sidewalk to the parking lot as far as there was cover overhead. When the cover ended, the drops fell on my hair. They would’ve quickened any normal person’s mindless march toward their car, their empty eyes peering over the concrete. That was the trick adults had over kids, wasn’t it? An ability to forget the immediate past so that the feeling of boredom or pain never cascaded over into the present. An ability that was equally their great flaw that prevented any strive towards a continuation of any good thing they felt in the past. My eyes were not empty. They were childish. My eyes looked about and filled themselves with the beauty the world had to offer, a beauty that existed as far as the beholder allowed it to. My watery eyes were desperate for it, for the hurt was cascading.</p>
<p>I stopped at the base of an oak tree not far out and slumped into a muddy patch between the roots. My shirt scrunched on the bark that poked into my back. I propped my arms on my knees and watched the rain. I would find no revelations under the empty tree. I was not Buddah nor Newton nor Eve. Lucas was right–those were stories, and I was Mickey Lee, the instrument-less bard whose thoughts coincided with the pitter-patter of the rain and the chattering of my teeth. The empty tree provided no coverage. The chilly breeze forcefully bartered with me the musky smell of wet soil for the heat that my bare skin had left over from inside.</p>
<p>We used to love the rain. George, Lucas, and I. Long ago, we ran our first 5k together in hundred degree heat. Then we ran our first 10k in rain. Our first 25k in light snow. The worse the weather, the better, because it was like seasoning for my dreams that made them feel more real. Mother nature dared us, and we always hit milestones when dared. But Mom would get mad when she spotted us running up the street in the rain or snow or heat. It was always “you’ll get pneumonia” or “you’ll get heatstroke” and then we’d be barred from running again the next day. It was fine because we would be too sore to run the next day anyway. We’d simply put on the act then take long showers and collapse in bed. “Never stand when you can sit, and never sit when you can lay down,” Coach had told us.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I thought it’d be a good idea to lay down under the tree. It was no more a good idea than to plop my butt into wet soil, one of those things you don’t realize was a bad idea until having done it despite being capable of knowing beforehand that your pants would get wet and dirty. But as I scooted and shifted onto my elbow so I could lay down, I caught Megan approaching from the side. She walked with her backpack slung over one shoulder where the strings of her sweatshirt oscillated with her steps, confused as to why I was reclining in the mud.</p>
<p>“Mind if I join you?” she asked.</p>
<p>I picked myself back up and rubbed the dirt off my elbow onto my jeans. “Are you skipping class too?”</p>
<p>She set her backpack down and sat in the mud next to me. “I was looking at the rain through the window on my way to class, and then I saw you sit under this tree, and I thought why watch the rain from the classroom if I wasn’t going to pay attention anyway?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m assuming it’s much nicer inside.”</p>
<p>“Warmer, yes,” she said, stuffing her hands in her jacket, “but if I wanted to be warm, I’d just go home and snuggle in bed.”</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow and leaned towards her. Like a loud noise, she gripped my attention. Maybe it was strange to be shocked over her answer, as everyone else in the building behind us was also there instead of home in bed, including Lucas who then seemed to be the type to lie in bed as long as his life let him, taking coach’s witty advice too seriously, but I was longing for her to give me something. It was as though I had reached a hurdle in my journey and like a lost wanderer in this forest of mine that was the scarce oak tree amongst a parking lot, I was hoping to stumble upon someone else along my path, upon which a loud noise most certainly is hopeful. Could Megan see what Lucas couldn’t?</p>
<p>“Why don’t you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Because I’m already here,” she mumbled–a disappointing, albeit honest answer. </p>
<p>I tried again, calling once more if anyone else was there. “You know, it’s one thing to stay in bed because it’s so cozy, but have you ever had the awe of your dreams keep you reminiscing over them long past your alarm?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really dream that much,” she said, striking my heart. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” I replied, and fell back against the tree, focusing on the rain and wet soil. Where was I to go?</p>
<p>“I can’t fathom skipping a day anyway,” she said. “My dad would kill me.”</p>
<p>I spotted a thin stick on the ground near my outstretched legs and picked it up. Being too damp, the stick refused to snap and settled for being folded into a zigzag pattern.</p>
<p>Megan pulled her hood over her head to cover the rain and picked up a twig with me. “So much of what I do is because he decided it for me.” </p>
<p>I found a much dryer stick closer to the base of the tree and snapped it into pieces, flicking away the small bits.</p>
<p>Megan shivered and tossed her twig. “There are times that I thought I’d say no or do something else without him knowing. But if I did, I wouldn’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>“That’s what makes it so fun,” I said, searching for another dry stick.</p>
<p>“But what if my direction is worse? Then that’s not so fun.”</p>
<p>I stopped running my hand over the ground. “What’s the alternative? Is his way of life something as fathomable as not missing a day of class, or does it make life seem dreadful?”</p>
<p>“Well, never missing a day does seem dreadful.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s a non-starter.”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” Megan said, “but that doesn’t mean I can just wish my feelings away. Don’t you know that? That’s what you told Hugo. I mean, imagine just deciding to stop caring about what your parents thought.”</p>
<p>What if I told her I had done just that?</p>
<p>“Do you just wish away the cold too?” she asked. “Or do you hide it?”</p>
<p>“I am cold,” I said. “I wasn’t planning on staying.”</p>
<p>“Where were you going?”</p>
<p>What if I tore off my mask and revealed my hand? How would she perceive me? The question lingered, and although I had a habit of asking too many questions, I hated the idea of being satisfied after only having asked the question. That particular question would not be sufficiently answered by my thinking of it. A question similar to asking “what if she likes me?”, where one could pace around the room as long as the idea of it being true brought a smile to their face, but the answer being utterly incomparable to the experience of if it were actually true and incomprehensibly disappointing if through years of inaction the intoxicating question became “what if she liked me?”. That question which haunted me over the prior weekend, blinding me from studying, which Lucas posed that I should’ve simply read aloud my thoughts sooner–there was no living with myself if I failed to reveal my hand to Megan.</p>
<p>“You two!” a teacher yelled from inside the alcove of the building. “Get out of the rain!” </p>
<p>“Why?” I called back. “It’s our lunch time.”</p>
<p>She broiled with anger. “Because I said so!” </p>
<p>I pitied her as much as I hated her, because asking why revealed who she was–someone who viewed us as children who required herding so she could deflect how old and spiteful she had become. The type of person who’d lock the school if it weren’t for the fire department.</p>
<p>“I guess we have to go,” Megan said.</p>
<p>My teeth ceased chattering and clenched. “What if you don’t listen to her?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean, do you want to come with me? Away from here?”</p>
<p>The teacher hurled more words our way, but the rain was enough to separate us from her. I waited in anticipation of Megan’s answer, hoping she would choose to listen to me instead.</p>
<p>“To where?” Megan asked.</p>
<p>“You said it sounded like a dreadful life ahead of you. If you really meant that, then I want to share something with you.”</p>
<p>—----------</p>
<p>The neighborhood was familiar. I knew the policies of the houses: who parked their cars in the driveway or garage, who took their trash out on trash day when they got home, and who mowed their own lawns religiously, tended to procrastinate, or gave up and hired someone else. I never noticed those things when just driving by. I wasn’t really there, after all. I was in a car with a top over my head, air conditioning on my skin, and music in my ears. Each house, car, or front yard tree would look like a stranger in a crowd. It was when we ran along the streets daily that I learned them, much like how I had a general idea at school of who was in what class at what time even though I didn’t know everyone. Still, there were always the uncertainties and fine-print details which added risk when walking past boundaries. I’d never be caught if people could tame their world as much as they desired, but sometimes people get sick or skip work or take a half-day. Sometimes people like Megan had those small adjustments in their life that made treading homes dangerous.</p>
<p>“I don’t like driving in the rain,” she replied, “and with all the traffic leaving school, the bus ride is faster anyway.”</p>
<p>“I never thought about that,” I said.</p>
<p>“Is it slower for you to take the bus?”</p>
<p>“Not enough for me to care.”</p>
<p>“Then why don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Because I never thought about it.”</p>
<p>The car bobbed onto the curb as I parked it. The engine shut off. The windshield wipers halted a quarter of their way up, like a pair of hungry lions crouched before the slender droplets accumulating on the glass. The rain had lightened to such a gentle drizzle that we would get no more wet than we already were. </p>
<p>“So this is where you live?” she asked.</p>
<p>“No,” I said, undoing my seatbelt and letting it slide up and smack against the interior. I grabbed my jacket from between our backpacks in the back seat and exited the car. </p>
<p>It was a short walk around the corner of the block. The street was quiet except for the lone mailman bouncing from one mailbox to the next and a plastic wrapper that skittered on the asphalt with the wind. A few houses down, I walked Megan up an empty driveway, rang the doorbell, and waited for a response.</p>
<p>“Who is this?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said.</p>
<p>She paused. “Then what are we doing? Selling girl scout cookies?”</p>
<p>“I asked if you would open yourself up and you said you would. Are you with me?”</p>
<p>“It depends, what are we doing?”</p>
<p>I wrapped my fingers around the door knob and swung it open. She faltered back a step. Her face twisted with the slow realization of what I wanted her to do.</p>
<p>I stepped in the doorway. “Come on in.”</p>
<p>“No,” she said, shaking her head. “This is illegal, and wrong, and weird.”</p>
<p>“We are just going in and out real quick,” I said. “No one knows we’re here.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on, we’re already here.”</p>
<p>The rain picked up to a downfall, like a barrier that entrapped us, and the wind swept it under the patio cover, darkening the concrete near her feet. The world was on Megan’s side nudging her towards the story she would otherwise not pursue. I outstretched my head where the warmth crept from the empty house. Megan peered up and down the street then took my hand, gently and with hesitance, so that I would have to make the decision for her. I pulled her inside onto the welcome mat and shut the door behind her. Then I took off my jacket and shoes as one would their own home.</p>
<p>“You are too sure of yourself,” she scoffed. She moved to take a step off the crowded mat, away from me, but I tugged her back.</p>
<p>“Shoes off first. I don’t want us to leave wet shoe prints.”</p>
<p>“Wet shoe prints?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’ll dirty the floor,” I said.</p>
<p>“You break into someone’s house and you worry about wet shoe prints?”</p>
<p>“I would not be doing this if I wasn’t wholly convinced it wouldn’t affect anyone but myself.”</p>
<p>She must’ve realized it wasn’t as spontaneous or dangerous as it seemed, as someone who is ready to run does not fold their arms. She must’ve realized that it was not my first rodeo, that there was an unsettling part of me she did not know, and with that part I was someone she no longer knew. In the parking lot, I had bet she had her own skeletons. Her entertaining of my idea, as reluctant as she was, was its own confession of guilt that I hoped was like mine. But her jeering tone frightened me, for guilty people judge and ridicule their own the most–that’s what the Christians taught me, anyway.</p>
<p>“How do you know there aren’t cameras or security systems?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Do you see any cameras or hear any alarms? Those aren’t things people hide. Now please, don’t be rude. Take off your shoes.”</p>
<p>“We’re well past that stage, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Please take me seriously for a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“Tell me what we’re doing here first.”</p>
<p>“I will, but you have to take your shoes off.”</p>
<p>She stopped on the heel of one shoe, slid her foot out, and kicked the shoe aside. Then she did her other shoe and threw her arms in the air. “There.”</p>
<p>I shook my head and turned back to the room before us. “Now tell me, what do you see?”</p>
<p>“I see a living room.”</p>
<p>“Be more specific.”</p>
<p>“This is ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“Just do it.”</p>
<p>“Okay, fine,” she said, and drew out a mockingly long response: “I see high ceilings and hardwood floors. A white leather coach pushed against a plastered wall. A cluttered wooden coffee table and a matching lounge chair under a plush rug. A television high above a red brick fireplace in the corner. And some plants on the windowsills that aren’t watered enough.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t what I wanted her to describe. She only saw the objects in the room, and not what they represented. I led her to the neighboring kitchen and tried again, “What do you see here?”</p>
<p>“Cabinets and granite counters lining the wall. A stove, microwave, and refrigerator. A bowl of fruit and some wadded receipts on an island. And a big wooden table in the corner.”</p>
<p>Again, she wasn’t catching on. I led her down a hallway to the master bedroom while she sighed and groaned and moved with three second delays.</p>
<p>“What do you see here?” I asked, my fingers crossed behind my back.</p>
<p>“A bed,” she said. “I see a fucking bed. Now why are we here?”</p>
<p>I walked her back into the living room and sat in the chair that was next to the couch. “Don’t you see how bland this house is?”</p>
<p>She stood uncomfortably in the middle of the room, one step toward the door. “I guess.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to make the place they call home unique beyond the utilities they fill it with. Where’s the accomplishments and awards and pieces that say ‘this is who I am’?”</p>
<p>“Maybe they think they are worth more than some plastic trophy on a shelf.”</p>
<p>“But it’s as though all they do is eat and sleep and watch t.v. and work.”</p>
<p>“This shouldn’t be news to you.”</p>
<p>“It’s not. Yet somehow, the obvious became non-obvious. These lives are meaningful and precious, but they are so uneventful that it makes me wonder why a life that is precious seems to only be wanted when it is comfortable.”</p>
<p>“So what? Maybe they are happy with that life.”</p>
<p>“Why be happy with life when you can be in awe like a child who can’t seem to get enough of it? To constantly wander and pursue dreams and stories now that we’re finally old enough and capable?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s hard,” she blurted, “and life is hard enough as is. People pour their energy into working all day and spend most of their free time doing chores. If they find happiness in relaxing with their family with the little free time they have left, who are you to criticize them?”</p>
<p>“The point of bringing you here was not to criticize them. It was to criticize myself! For you to criticize me–surely you have some opinion about me. I see a new path I need to follow to feel good about how I live, but I have no idea what it is I’m supposed to be doing or why I should do it and I can’t seem to find anyone else who understands. I’m lost, why is that? Why am I so alone with these thoughts?</p>
<p>“You’re asking why you’re lost? Can’t you tell?” Megan asked, waving around the room. “You’ve declared everyone is living complacently and therefore wrongly before ever having come up with the correct way. Then you try to find your own way and fail. That’s okay, it happens at our age. But instead of accepting that, you double down and cry about it, and you expect me to sympathize with you like a child.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am a child. You think I’m a child with a bad attitude, but I am a child with feelings that I can’t understand because I do not know them by name. I am a child with how little of the world I realize I understand day by day. Everyone seems to be right and me wrong. But that’s the thing–everyone is clearly wrong about something. Otherwise this world would be a righteous place. What is it that is wrong? How wrong are we? How monumentally consequential is our wrongness?”</p>
<p>“See, there you go again. You act like your problems are not because you’re incapable of growing up and moving on, but because of everyone else’s shortcomings. Even if that were true, it does no good to drag me into it and expect me to have the answers. It seems that all you want is some form of validation, but I’m not going to give it to you.”</p>
<p>“When you first stepped into this house, don’t you remember how fast your heart was going? When we were in the back of your car that night, don’t you remember how alive we felt? Please tell me you do. For me, there’s no denying it, and once I’ve felt it, I can’t unfeel it. There’s no going back; it’s worth more than anything. I know I’m not the only one. I know you’ve felt it. So why am I the only one who struggles to move on? I’m not asking for your validation, I’m asking you why don’t you struggle?”</p>
<p>“I enjoyed the moments, yes. But the high wears off, time moves on, and I have to start treating life seriously again, just as you need to.”</p>
<p>“No, no, that’s not the point.” I threw my arms behind my head and leaned back. “What does it mean to take our short life seriously? Does it mean to wake up early, eat healthy, climb the corporate ladder, and make good financial choices? There’s no urgency in that life. It’s treating death like it’s some far, far, off distant event that you’ll deal with when you get there. How would your life change if you were diagnosed with an illness that would end your life in 20 years? Would it be different than if it were 10 years? 5 years? Where’s the line, how many years before the understanding arises that there’s only so many Christmas’s left before you cease to exist? At what point do we treat our days like they are truly limited, where there’s no more time to care about treading the calmest waters because there’ll be no more water left? It was never about how many years we were from death–it is about what we will lose when it comes and what we are losing with each passing day.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t getting it. My young tongue was incapable of articulating the blackhole that was beneath me, all the meanwhile as I tried, my mind connected dots and faltered under the new question: What did it mean to no longer exist? It was a concept I never grasped before, as heavy as the moral responsibility would be for one who witnessed the resurrection of Christ–an infinite weight whose only possible perpetrator was that mindless black hole lured in at the perfect time by the most clever devil. But there was a void on the other side of the room that overcame the force, unitless, unquantifiable, and unnerving. It pulled to it my eyes that were wandering across the ceiling as I spoke where Megan was silently headed to the door.</p>
<p>“Wait, what’s wrong?” I asked.</p>
<p>She began shuffling her shoes on. “I expected better of you.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You look at everyone like they’re idiots!”</p>
<p>“That’s not true at all,” I said.</p>
<p>“You brought me into someone’s house to tell me how stupid they are,” she retorted. “Is that how you see me?”</p>
<p>“I think you misunderstand me–”</p>
<p>“No, I think I understand just fine,” she said. “I’ve dealt with a hundred guys like you who all think they’re special, that they’re smarter than everyone else and figured out everything that no one else has. You’re no different and I naively thought you were. I must be as stupid as you think!”</p>
<p>The sound of the rain amplified with the door’s opening, and muffled with the slam shut behind her.</p>
<p>I lunged from the chair and desperately tied my shoes. By the time I got outside, Megan was walking down the sidewalk in the opposite direction of my car. I would’ve chased after her, but the rain was heavy. Instead, I sprinted around the corner to my car. The cold air reminded me that I had left the jacket in the house. It was too late to go back though; My relationship with Megan was worth more than the jacket.</p>
<p>I jumped into the car and thrust my keys into the socket and sped around the corner before Megan got far. I rolled the car alongside her at walking speed and yelled, “Get in!”</p>
<p>She chose to trudge through the torrent.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry!” I said, but she refused to stop. “I was trying to open up.”</p>
<p>She kept walking. Apology, confession, acknowledgement–nothing was working.</p>
<p>“Let me at least drive you home. I won’t say a word.”</p>
<p>She stopped and thought for a moment. Then her clothes squished against the leather seat. She slammed the door shut. “Not a word.”</p>
