<p>The sun rose well above the tree line before Jenny’s phone woke us both. We lied on the windowsill on display for the world to see—from the buildings downtown if one so pleased. Jenny scrambled for her phone mangled somewhere in the sheets.</p>
<p>"Hey Dad,” she answered, walking to the bathroom for privacy, “sorry I missed your calls.”</p>
<p>When she shut the door, I could only make out bits of the muffled conversation: Mrs. Lebedeva’s surgery was an apparent success; She would stay to recover for a couple of days; Mr. Lebedev had just landed at the airport and would be home soon; My inserted hand in the family’s affairs was officially removed.</p>
<p>I wanted her dad to stay with her mom, and her to stay with me and let Lucas and I handle things, but it was her family. Not mine.</p>
<p>As she continued babbling in the bathroom, I tried calling Lucas to see how he was holding up. No sooner did it go to voicemail before Jenny walked out.</p>
<p>“Can you drop me off at the hospital so I can get my car?” Her voice was light like a yawn and her composure was not much different than mine--that of a teenager on a Monday morning.</p>
<p>How could the two of us be so lifeless after last night? I expected to be wailing, pissed, or determined. Something at a pivotal moment of my life. What was this sick joke of limbo?</p>
<p>I begrudgingly drove her to the hospital, and when my second call to Lucas went to voicemail, I drove to his house next. No thoughts, podcasts, or music drained out the various noises of the car. There was merely enough energy in my bones to complain about traffic and potholes and maybe get angry at minor inconveniences.</p>
<p>The length of Lucas’s driveway was barren. The only light in his house was of the sun squeezing in through the curtains. The doorbell echoed throughout the house; no one returned its ping. I rang the doorbell again, and again, to the point that any answer would be tremendously awkward because I had nowhere to go but to loiter in a half-empty parking lot.</p>
<p>Then did I realize my disconnect to the world. I was a vagrant to society. I was an outcast pushed out just far enough that I could see the forest as a whole instead of individual trees, weeds, and overgrown roots. From my perch, it was looked to me like humans really were just another specie in the chain of evolution and I had the unfortunate circumstance of being born just too early.</p>
<p>My awe turned to rot. Yet, it was all only meagerly disappointing. At my core I knew it to be true. It just finally manifested itself as it does in everyone at some point, when we let our feet become still and the cement around us hardens and by the old age we realize, we have no choice but to accept it. I thought myself to be young and able to catch it early, like waiting for a mosquito to inevitably land on my arm. How audacious to think myself able to escape the grip of nihilism.</p>
<p>A woman slammed shut the door of a car across the street. I watched her pull away in a rush amidst an isolated road. No one but her occupied it. Like the world was taking off on some spaceship and she missed the alarm as I had, except no one told me because I was the outcast.</p>
<p>Between the desire to live my dreams and the apparent meaninglessness of the world—and consequently society and its rules—I skipped in pep and imprudence down the steps and across the street.</p>
<p>I knew what was expected of me. I was supposed to drive back home, lay in bed and grieve George, then move on the next day back into routine. I was to honor George by writing about him in my statement of purpose and using him as an identity to get pity-laid (and perhaps I would), but to never dare step further.</p>
<p>Society shaped me to respect its boundaries—very strict boundaries that let them live boring lives. Yet, they didn’t give a fuck about anyone else. So who were they to demand my unreciprocated respect? Fuck them, their norms, their wonts, their self-worship, and their narrowed, forever turning world.</p>
<p>I peered in through the windows by the front door, forming a cove with my hands to block the glare. There was no security system nor camera in sight. I rang the doorbell and waited. When no one answered, I put one hand to the door and the other to the knob. When I turned my hand, the knob turned with it, and I swung the door open and let the cool air breeze past me.</p>
<p>"Show yourself now or forever hold your peace" I mumbled. No dogs barked, no other doors opened, no chairs squeaked, nor couches groaned, so I stepped inside and shut the door behind me.</p>
<p>The boundaries truly were meaningless. I hadn’t so much as trekked a grain of dirt in. Stepping in the unoccupied house was like stealing a piece of gum from a millionaire. It was an action so inconsequential it didn't deserve the thought and was best left to the moralists like law is left to lawyers. Meanwhile its antithesis was an ethic conventionally held yet never contemplated. How could I take such a value seriously?</p>
<p>It was impossible to do so with the thrill surreal and shocking. It was like seeing a color you never knew existed. My heart raced.</p>
<p>But I was a dog chasing cars. I chased after ‘living a life’ all this time, and now that I caught it, I did not really know what to do with it.</p>
<p>So, shortly thereafter, I left the house. Better then than before someone saw me there, anyway. But before leaving, I pulled the cash from a wallet sitting on a table by the door, intending to donate it or something. Something better than sitting in a wallet of someone who did not need it.</p>
<p>From then on, a precedent was set.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I returned to school two days later. Hardly a single step through the front doors was granted before I was escorted to Principal Fritz’s office. And so the identity was thrust upon me—I officially became that kid. Kind of like the one I always was jealous of. Not that I had any say in the matter. I simply felt plucked from the herd and forever struck with the mark of an alien; a heretic and a dissident and a vagrant; a no good egomaniac who thought himself to be in a world of insentient beings with no care other than that of their own subconscious desires.</p>
<p>Fritz’s office was bare. Behind him were walls of glass covered in black blinds, angled to let only light in and no wavering eyes grasping at becoming king or queen of the day’s gossip. Nothing other than his heavy oak desk, a bookshelf of presumably unread books and documents, and a large fern in the corner furnished the room. It was enough to make it seem like an office, but he could leave at any time, and no one would’ve known it was occupied in the first place.</p>
<p>He sat with perfect posture in a large, leather chair behind his desk, while Lucas and I sat in plastic chairs. Everything about his office shouted he was in charge and not anyone else, but who he was almost remained a mystery. Even the title upon his desk read in bold, golden letters “Principal” without “Fritz” appended to the end.</p>
<p>“How are you two?” he asked, a frown stretching across his face and his brows furrowing in a measly attempt to appear sympathetic.</p>
<p>“Fine,” I muttered.</p>
<p>Lucas laughed and slumped back in his chair. “Yeah, that about sums it up.”</p>
<p>How did he appear so… content?</p>
<p>“I wanted to remind you two,” Principal Fritz said, “that there are resources we can provide to help you.”</p>
<p>“Like what?” I blurted.</p>
<p>Fritz, in his hesitation, clearly did not know the next line of the formalities. He was simply checking boxes in the early intervention guide. “We have a counselor on campus that you can visit any time. We have programs in place to help students with grief. We can direct you to psychologists.”</p>
<p>I showed no interest. The last thing I wanted was to talk with a pencil-pushing counselor and be prescribed a low dose of Prozac.</p>
<p>“I also wanted to give you a heads up,” Fritz said. “There is a memorial in the hall for George.”</p>
<p>A memorial? Of fucking course. It would be strange for them to not set up a memorial. It would be strange for everyone to not change their bios to ‘fly high George!’</p>
<p>“We appreciate it, Mr. Fritz,” said Lucas.</p>
<p>“We?” I reproached.</p>
<p>“Would you rather pretend it never happened?”</p>
<p>“George would not care about some memorial.”</p>
<p>Fritz stepped in. “Mickey, it’s not for George. It’s for his peers--including you--to acknowledge that he is no longer with us. To mourn his loss and hopefully find closure. I know it hurts, but now’s the time that we grieve.”</p>
<p>I tuned out the rest of the conversation. Shortly thereafter, we left back into the halls where eyes poked at us. I walked right past the memorial.</p>
<p>When we reached my locker, Lucas quietly asked, “What do you have against a memorial?”</p>
<p>“It’s swarmed by people I don’t even know. It’s a disgrace.”</p>
<p>“We don’t own a monopoly on mourning him.”</p>
<p>“You know exactly what I mean. They don’t feel like we do.”</p>
<p>Lucas fell into silence as I fumbled my padlock. I did not like being in the hall. If I knew people would stare, I would have stayed home.</p>
<p>“This sucks,” Lucas blurted. “I know. I get it. I don’t want to argue with you. I want to grieve with you, then start taking steps forward, because I can’t take this anymore. I can’t stay with a hole in my heart forever. I need this, Mickey. We need this. You know we do. Life is moving forward whether we like it or not, and it is best we don’t let it drag us along by a rope around our neck through rain and mud. We can’t fall off or it’ll be hell getting back on because it won’t stop and no one else will even look back for us.”</p>
<p>“How can you be so logical about this?” I questioned. “Our best friend…” My voice trailed into thought. I was going to say “died” but George didn’t die. Then again, what was the memorial for? Why was Fritz and Lucas talking about mourning and grieving George? What was all this staring about? I could feel time slow down around me. “George is still alive, right?”</p>
<p>Lucas met my eyes. “Oh, Mickey, you didn’t know?”</p>
<p>“Know what? What do I not know?”</p>
<p>Lucas refused to answer.</p>
<p>I gripped his shirt. “Tell me!”</p>
<p>But he did not have to. He knew he did not. I knew too. </p>
<p>I was finding this out here, because of a dumb ass memorial, of all places. My breathing struggled to keep up. I let go of Lucas’s shirt and fell back against the locker. The world felt less real by the second. I caught sight of people gawking at me collapse. I could not stay here. I jerked away and pushed my way against the incoming flow of people through the front doors and ran to my car. Fritz didn’t want me leaving without his control–not wanting another incident at his school–but no one could stop me.</p>
<p>I drove off to a vacant parking lot, and then looked for an empty house that could cloud my mind and speed my heart’s monotonous pulse. I wanted to infatuate my life with music and thrill and pain like we did when we ran, yet running would now only bring me back to what I was trying to escape from.</p>
