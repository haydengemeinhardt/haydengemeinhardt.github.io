<p>A dreadful thing happened at school on Monday.</p>
<p>Before the day had a chance to start, Margaret’s words shot across the hallway in a scathing cry, “Jenny is a backstabbing bitch and a whore!”</p>
<p>Jenny was absent from her friend group, which by then meant she was running late that morning, so Megan seized her opportunity. Conversations quieted as scattered crowds tuned in and Megan went off. Only, Jenny wasn’t as late as Megan thought: she was around the corner. She stopped mid-stride with her mouth hung open, then turned around in fret and stormed into the girl’s bathroom.</p>
<p>Maragaret caught sight of me, and scowled. I shook my head and walked away. I didn’t know what Margaret was on about. The grades below were all strangers to me. Still, I wished she had waited before piling on top of Jenny with my outburst the day before. </p>
<p>It hadn’t been a day, and yet there was a part of me clinging on that still cared about Jenny. It had also <i>only</i> been a day, and less than half that since I was up thinking about Megan, how she might’ve not been who I thought she was, how she was in part a product of my own perception of her with all my biases and assumptions. It wasn’t that I still cared for Megan. It wasn’t that I didn’t still care for her. It was that there was an essence of Megan, of everyone, which was so far out of her control that I only knew the girl I thought she was. What then of the question that Jenny was the same, that the Lebedev legend was but a myth made up in my mind, and that Jenny had the unfortunate circumstance of inheriting it? I asked myself these questions time and time again, but I refused to accept anything different. After Megan, I had no choice. These banners demanded acceptance. But as quickly as the question of Jenny arose, so did the question of George. What if Lucas was right, that the boy who I envied had a miserable life with no greatness on the other side? For just as the banners demanded I accepted a different Jenny, they demanded I toss away my old desires, and I ceased to see the good in his distress. Then maybe Jenny and George were indeed alike, in a different light.</p>
<p>I yawned as I dragged the ball and chain to class. The questions were the heaviest they had ever been. My ankle was sore, and there was no sign I’d ever remove the limp in my step. I handed in my homework as I entered math class, adding it to the pile at the corner of Mr. Frederick’s desk. When the bell rang, Mr. Frederick straightened the stack of papers and stuffed them in his bag—no one was ever late on homework hand-in day, which was a big ask for Monday morning. He then closed the classroom door and grabbed a marker from the tray lining the white board. “Let’s go over last week’s homework,” he said, squeaking open the marker. “Does anyone want to choose where we start?”</p>
<p>Next to me, Alana—my new partner since the seating chart was rearranged—raised her hand while pulling out her notebook. Mr. Frederick pointed at her. </p>
<p>“Could we do problem five?,” she asked. “I wasn’t sure about my answer.”</p>
<p>A few others and I nodded in agreement hoping that he’d grade easier with feedback.</p>
<p>“Problem five, that’s a fun one!” He wrote it on the board: 1 + tan^2(x) = sec^2(x). </p>
<p>I flipped my notebook to the next new page and wrapped the other half around the coil.</p>
<p>“I got that tangent squared x is sine squared x over cosine squared x,” she said, “and that secant squared x is one over cosine squared x.”</p>
<p>“Right,” he replied, scribbling it on the board. “Do you know the next step?”</p>
<p>“That’s where I got stuck.”</p>
<p>“Let me give you a hint,” he said, writing: sin^2 + cos^2 = 1</p>
<p>She grabbed her chin and peered at the board. “So then we substitute that in for the one?”</p>
<p>Mr. Frederick tilted his head side to side. “You could, but there’s an easier way.” He wrote: 1 = cos^2(x) / cos^2(x), then an arrow pointing to the original equation, and combined the two terms on the left side to make (cos^2(x)+sin^(2)) / cos^2(x). </p>
<p>“Oh, I see!” Alana exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I’ll grade that problem a little easier,” he said. “It’s a tough one every year.”</p>
<p>I had done the problem a different way. I hoped it would work. I wrote his solution down regardless.</p>
<p>“Next problem,” Mr. Frederick said. “Any takers?”</p>
<p>No one raised their hands, so he returned to question one: prove that (1 - sin^2(x)) * sec^2(x) = 1.</p>
<p>It was the monotony of daily life. It was what lied between the highs and the lows, if we were lucky enough to have them. Lucas was not in my class to disagree, nor was George seated next to me to smack me for how I treated his sister. George was no longer with me at all, leaping from peak to peak, sometimes tripping and tumbling down before passing me on his climb back up. Alana did her best that morning, but even George would cease to inspire me. His inspiration hinged on living a great life. The qualities of a great life were no longer clear. As blasphemous as it was to admit, his peaks had crumbled like the groaning and cracking of giant withering trees, the largest ones crashing the hardest. His mountains might've been carved from the earth-shaking clash of the tectonic plates that carried humankind, but they dwarfed in comparison to the collision of two stars—highs that filled the universe with mystery and lows so low not even light could escape—and I ought to have not viewed his with the same awe thereafter. I ought to have not viewed anything with awe thereafter. I ought to have only accepted my newly confounded reality.</p>
<p>But then I had the strangest feeling—when I thought of George, I thought of Jenny. I peeked through the slim window in the door wondering if I’d see her in the hallway, if she was as tortured by monotony as I. </p>
<p>—--</p>
<p>“I’ll talk to her,” Hugo said as we left second block history. “Megan can be a bit unreasonable at times, but she’s not stubborn.”</p>
<p>Hugo, as far as I knew, only knew as far as I told him, which was that I expressed some opinions to Megan poorly and she took offense.</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t have to do that,” I said.</p>
<p>“Sure I do. I don’t want two of my friends to split apart.”</p>
<p>Megan often would stop to say hello between bells since she had class two rooms down. That day, she huddled with some other friends in the hallway without batting us an eye.</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to think she’s being unreasonable,” I whispered after we passed her by.</p>
<p>“You know how girls can be,” Hugo said, then corrected himself. “You know how people can be. People can have unfair reactions.”</p>
<p>“Even so,” I said, “I never meant to drag you into it.”</p>
<p>“Well, whether you intended to or not, she’s over there, you’re over here, and I’m beginning to ask myself why I don’t just go over there.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead then,” I bluffed.</p>
<p>Hugo laughed. “I’m joking.”</p>
<p>We continued past a few more rooms towards the staircase we normally split at. Before we arrived, I caught Jenny dart across the intersection and out the door. No one left that way unless they were leaving. The teachers would’ve locked it themselves after the first bell if it weren’t for pesky fire codes. And if anyone did go out that way, especially when it was cold, it caught everyone’s attention. </p>
<p>She wasn’t supposed to catch mine though. The Jenny that was George’s sister, the one that worked with me in the shop, the one that slept with me on the windowsill, the one that talked with me in the pool, the one that wanted to know who I was in the parking lot, didn’t matter anymore. She was dead. It was as out of my control as it was out of hers, for just as her mask was shoved against her will, it was a mask molded in those subconscious roots of mine that were beyond my grasp. </p>
<p>The Jenny that remained, however, who too had lived the same life, was equally affected, and bled from her wound for reasons unknown to her. She was a stranger, a girl I had never known, and I had yet to apologize.</p>
<p>“I’ll catch you later,” I told Hugo, and squeezed through the hallway after Jenny with the excuse to talk to her in hand. My squeezing quickly became pushing as I cut across traffic towards the door—the gaps were blocked by backpacks, and people were too wrapped up in conversation to make room.</p>
<p>After I broke free, I exited outside. The air was brisk, and quiet as the tumultuous crowd was closed off inside, with only the intermittent whoosh on the nearby road. I spotted Jenny already nearing the parking lot and quickened my pace to catch up. I followed her down the sidewalk and between the oak trees that I once sat, but lost her as she cut between cars. I began jogging, then running, then sprinting as I tried to find her row by row of the vast monochrome landscape, bumping and folding mirrors as I bashed between the gaps of parked cars. How had she outrun me? Once one of the three great track stars of the renowned TRHS? </p>
<p>A car spurred alive a couple of rows behind me. Before I could run back, she pulled out of her spot and drove down the row, her front bumper sticking out her back window.</p>
<p>I would’ve kept chasing after her, but I had chemistry homework to turn in. I sighed and headed back inside.</p>
<p>—--------</p>
<p>On my way home after school, I took a detour past Jenny’s to see if she was home. A text would’ve been easier. So would’ve catching her the next day at school. But I wanted to apologize to her sooner rather than later, and had been to her house so many times it wasn’t strange to stop by. There was another reason, though, unmentioned and lurking, in that it gave me the excuse to daydream about relieving an inescapable itch that came on some time after lunch, like an alcoholic peeking down the liquor aisle—an itch that a part of me knew should’ve remained unitched. A deeper part of me, though—a part I was too ashamed to admit existed—hoped I would be convinced otherwise upon impulsively agreeing to be tempted, as the other part was with the naive belief that I’d be able to resist going further after a gentle scratch.</p>
<p>When I turned down her street, I noticed her car was not in the driveway, which either meant she got George’s spot in the garage or she was at work. I drove by slowly and peered in the windows. There was no sign anyone was inside, so it was likely the latter, and that dark part of me had the fortunate excuse that the cafe was too far out of my way. So I parked down a side street a block away and made my way to the front door to double check. </p>
<p>I rang the doorbell. It didn’t echo. It was one of the things I liked about their house: it was quaint and soft, and at that time empty. </p>
<p>The thought was too tempting. I shouldn’t have been there. I ferociously shook my head and told myself it was time to leave. I tried to return to my car, but a hook clipped the collar of my shirt and was being reeled back toward the house. I halted, and sighed, then followed silently and without thought, for I knew what thought would say.</p>
<p>I was that alcoholic who, after peering down the aisle, touched one of the bottles, and was overcome with such an intense glimpse of euphoria that they assured themselves it was too late despite being able to walk out, despite being able to throw away their purchase, despite not having to continue after the first sip, before every sip became just one more until they were so close to relief that it was undoubtedly too late when, indeed, they could’ve still stopped.</p>
<p>The door was locked, but a key was hidden in the large flower pot by the door just below the dirt. I retrieved it and wiped it off, then entered the home. Its scent flooded me with nostalgia—a pleasant musty smell of furniture older than me: an antique pine sideboard, a brown leather couch and a complimentary recliner, a honey oak entertainment center encasing a small TV, and low-pile carpet. I shut the door and let the home take me back to a lost time. </p>
<p>The living room was all so familiar—so familiar that something out of place caught my eye. On a half-cluttered coffee table was an uncapped bottle of vodka and, next to it, a shot glass that was still wet to the touch. It did not belong there. I screwed the cap onto the bottle and stored it in the sideboard, clanking its glass against the others, then carried the shot glass to the kitchen and washed it before setting it in the cabinet, bypassing the dishwasher to save them the shame.</p>
<p>To the right of the sink were a few photos pinned by magnets to the fridge. I hadn’t seen George’s face except in its likeness of Jenny’s for many weeks; George and I didn’t have many pictures together. I mused over them: one picture was him in elementary school holding a plaque for student of the year, smiling with orange and green braces in front of a playful bulletin board in the hallway; beside it was one of him more mature, standing on the brick red track in running gear with a gold medal, lean, drenched, and exhausted, yet triumphant; and below that was him buttressed by his proud parents with Jenny in front—not at the forefront, just the front.</p>
<p>I returned to the living room then walked down to the end of the adjacent hallway into George’s old room. His bed was made without a crease in the fabric. In the carpet by the foot of his dresser remained a stain where I once spilled hot chocolate. Atop the dresser was his TV and console that we’d rush to play the campaign of a new videogame. Left lazily in the dust under the TV was an old deck of cards we used to gamble Halloween candy with at a younger age. On either side of the TV stood speakers that could be cranked loud enough to provoke George’s father—once when Lucas and I had to get payback, I held George back while Lucas locked the door and turned up the music. We had a childhood’s worth of memories in that room alone. </p>
<p>I smiled. I no longer saw the George that was a composer of great symphonies. I only saw the George that was my old friend of great memories.</p>
<p>The room next door was Jenny’s. It was almost a mirror of George’s, except purposefully rearranged so it wasn’t. I had been in it once or twice. I never thought I’d look in it as I did then, as a room of someone I once hardly knew, then thought I knew, then knew not at all; a room that became more intriguing than the last, holding mystery over memory. </p>
<p>On her side of the Jack-and-Jill bathroom, she had left a light on. It was one of Jenny’s bad habits that her dad didn’t take so kindly to, and George wasn’t there to fix it for her before her dad got home. I moved to turn it off. As I flipped the switch, I looked into the bathroom—I jumped back. </p>
<p>Jenny was in the bath tub! Like at the crack of a starting pistol I was ready to run, but I was stunned in confusion. Why was there no jolt when I hit the light? Not a ripple or wade of water? And why was there no response when I rang the bell, entered the house, or carelessly clanked and creaked about? Stranger still, why was all but her eyes under the water? Yes—only her closed eyes were above the water.</p>
<p>I should’ve left, but I had grown too comfortable and too curious. I peaked around the corner again. Jenny remained motionless in the white fiberglass tub. I pulled back and tapped my knuckles against the door, listening for the sound of water. Silence. I knocked again with force, holding the doorknob so it didn’t swing away. Nothing. A thought crossed my mind, but it seemed absurd. I looked back toward the living room, where I found the half-empty bottle. The thought then seemed possible, but it didn’t seem real. </p>
<p>I had been there before. I had heard the nurses talk. It takes minutes to drown. Even if she was under the entire time I was there, she could’ve still been okay. I was supposed to check. </p>
<p>What if she was perfectly fine? How humiliating it would’ve been for me! How embarrassing it would’ve been for her! But could I have ever forgiven myself if I spared us the indignities in the off chance that she needed to be saved? What started as a thrill was no longer a thrill. It was a wicked game of luck and circumstance, and the world said your move. The world that I dared existed merely in my mind.</p>
<p>—---</p>
<p>Entering homes was no longer a thrill. It was a neat trick. I used to steal gum for the same innocent thrill of a heist, but that thrill too had worn off until I was left with nothing but a sore jaw and a pocket full of melted gum. When I stole for the first time, I stole because it was exhilarating and intoxicating. The tenth time, it was to chase the high of my innocent past.</p>
<p>All emotions seemed to lose their potency over time in similar ways. Even a good song loses its magic. But life? Was the awe of living but an emotion that the older I grew, the more content I was with letting go?—that was the question I asked myself for a long time, and when the scales finally tipped, a ball and chain tumbled out, and a gun pressed into my back demanding that I keep it that way. </p>
<p>Standing in Jenny’s bathroom, once I would’ve thought a great story of life lied before me, and that I was graciously given one last chance to grab it or forever sulk in monotony. How selfish! Then, I was ordered to ask myself: What did I care about a great story? What did I care about saving face? What did I care about humiliation? What did I care about Jenny? And I was ordered to answer on cue: nothing! How cold! I didn’t want that heartless truth. But reason dictated that what I wanted no longer mattered, for reason had decapitated me, and thereby dissipated my cognizance of reality.</p>
<p>To renounce belief in one’s ego, to deny one’s own “reality”—what a triumph!* But what was I missing? Why was I as a champion of my own world lured into Jenny’s home like a dog with a bone? And why did the new foundation leave me in such a haze when faced with what was in front of me? For if I was to leave to save face, it would be no different than to check on her because I cared for her—both but an animalistic response—and if I was to leave because there was no reason for me to care for her, it would be no different than to check on her because there was no reason to leave. I was commanded into heartlessness. I was commanded into a contradiction of nothingness. I was commanded into limbo.</p>
<p>I quickly realized that the new “foundation” was not a sturdy replacement for the old decrepit one. Instead of there having been new supports to save me from crashing into the ground, the ground itself was removed like some sick joke, and an infinite chasm left me in freefall.</p>
<p>Truly, in that moment, no one, no matter how nihilistic they may be, could say Jenny’s life was not worth trying to save because the old foundations were so fatally insufficient, that it was better to stubbornly remain in infinite freefall than to crash against the vulnerability of setting aside existential questions to focus on what was presented before them which, shaky as it was, at least enabled a life that one could call human. Might it have been more vulnerable to walk out, and stubborn to stay? Did it matter?—no, what did I care? And if the gun pressed into my back cocked, what did I care? </p>
<p>The pinch in my spine disappeared. The gun was finally holstered, satisfied with my answer. </p>
<p>I entered and touched Jenny’s shoulder. She did not move, but the warm touch of her skin meant more than anything had ever meant in my life. It meant that which I would give everything of mine to preserve—all joy and happiness and thrill in life succumbed to it. That no matter how chemically or animalistically the desire may have been that brought it about, it existed, it drove, and it was as objective to me as my own existence. It was an undeniable truth that would forever prove me wrong.</p>
