								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Twenty</h1><br>
<p>In six months, Lucas was to graduate, George was to be forgotten, and I was to be released from the colorless cell whose barred windows goaded me to delirium. </p>
<p>The only thing that kept me tethered to the world was I had as many visits as the system would allow. It wasn’t a lot. Dad came by, Bobby came by, even Mom and her boyfriend came by. Yet, I’d tell them all that I had one less visit allowed per month than I actually did, for the last Wednesday evening of every month, Hugo stopped by after school to visit. It was also the one visit a month I was allowed to host my guest without a thick pane of glass separating us. It was the best I could do to mend my relationship with Hugo, despite it resting solely in his hands at that point.</p>
<p>The visitation room was larger than I had expected. It was larger than it would ever be filled except perhaps on Thanksgiving or Christmas Eve, so I was able to grab a table with some modicum of privacy. </p>
<p>The room was reminiscent of any other publicly funded room: the tables were round and of a light-brown wood from decades past; three padded chairs of that ugly, faded cyan circled each table; the linoleum floors were of a dusty, off-white tint; and on the far side of the room were vending machines accompanied by a couple of paintings that were as bland as the walls they were set upon. But the tables were sturdy and the chairs didn’t creak and the floors didn’t squeak and the lights were bright and the paintings complemented one another. Was it really better than Café Du Mont? It seemed so.</p>
<p>The door creaked open as a guard let Hugo in. Hugo scoured the room, found me, and hastened over.</p>
<p>I rose from my chair and embraced him.</p>
<p>“You know,” he said, “this isn’t quite what I thought you had in mind when you left my house that day.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” I asked, slumping into my chair.</p>
<p>“You said you were so close to life being within your grasp,” he said, clasping the air as to mimic my proclamation, “and that you knew what you needed to do. Then next thing we know--”</p>
<p>“Did Lucas tell you everything?”</p>
<p>Hugo paused mid-gesticulation, then dropped his arm and fell into the chair. “No, I just heard you from the other side of the house. You’re so loud I’m surprised it took them that long to catch you.”</p>
<p>“The trick is to not be anywhere there’s people to catch you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, how’d that work out?” he asked, laughing.</p>
<p>“Great until someone showed up.”</p>
<p>“Correct me if I’m wrong,” Hugo said, “the walls did muffle some of your yelling. But I thought you promised this life was behind you?”</p>
<p>“It was behind me,” I replied, “right behind me, in fact. Close enough to catch a hold of my wrist.”</p>
<p>“I thought so. You left, and then the next thing Lucas and I knew, the police were knocking on my door.”</p>
<p>“They were there that fast?”</p>
<p>“First off, fuck you,” Hugo said, “Secondly, not really. Lucas and I talked for a while after you left. He’s a cool dude.”</p>
<p>I nodded, then I remembered how the police had caught me where I told Lucas I was going. “Did you two tell them that I was going to see Jenny?”</p>
<p>Hugo shook his head. “Lucas didn’t say a word to the police. I did all of the talking, and I guess I didn’t hear that part. Which, respect to him. He could’ve got more time than you for that.”</p>
<p>He probably wasn’t wrong. Six months was relatively short, despite the eternity it affected, and I had got lucky at that with Bobby and being young and being hurt and convincing the judge I merely trespassed instead of attempted robbery. “I guess so,” I said.</p>
<p>“Aiding and abetting and all that.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… I haven’t heard a word from him though.”</p>
<p>“I know you were trying to fix that relationship,” Hugo said, “but I think it might be best to forget about it for now. You two finally talk again, and you lied to his face then got him wrapped up in an investigation. What did you think was going to happen? He was pissed when the officer showed up—”</p>
<p>“Okay, I get it!” </p>
<p>Hugo tossed up his hands. Our table went silent. People around the room eyed our direction, as though a sudden hush fell across a crowd. Was I really that loud?</p>
<p>Chattering around the room resumed after a moment. Our table remained silent. Not because of an uneasy tension—no such thing could exist between me and Hugo. No, neither of us knew what to say next. </p>
<p>I propped my head on my hand and let my eyes wander off.  Hugo crossed his arms and leaned back. One would think two good friends who hadn’t seen each other in weeks would never run a conversation dry so quickly. I think he was trying to let me carry the conversation where I wanted it to go, but there was so much I could’ve talked about that I didn’t feel like talking about anything at all.</p>
<p>Hugo turned his head to where I was looking. “You want something from the vending machine? I bet you haven’t had anything good to eat in weeks.”</p>
<p>“It’s not much worse than school food to be honest. And we get more food per meal, so it’s not that bad,” I said, but then a speck of curiosity arose, “although, I would like a cup of coffee.”</p>
<p>“Let me go get you some,” he said, and went to slide a bill into the coffee machine. </p>
<p>Hugo smiled at me from across the room as he put a cup under the nozzle and waited for coffee to spill out. I don’t know what it was, but the notion of Hugo again helping me out in such a simple way because of my own inability churned my heart with a tight grasp. Then picturing Jenny in the same spot, with a sharpie to scribble my name and dot my i, plunged my heart into a void. I hadn’t heard from Jenny since the night at the hospital, and I couldn’t blame her. It still hurt though. Deeply.</p>
<p>Hugo returned with two cups and placed one in front of me. </p>
<p>I blew ripples across the steamy surface then took a sip. “Interesting,” I mumbled.</p>
<p>“What?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” I replied, but in my mind, I thought even the coffee is better. “Do you know how Jenny has been doing? I haven’t heard from her either.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” he said. “I know she was out of school for a couple of weeks. But I don’t really talk to her.”</p>
<p>The care for my life was gone—lost within that bath and never quite found again. I really thought I had a way out of the mess with that undeniable truth of love I thought I found. But with each passing day, the love I had hurt more than it helped. I didn’t lie to Jenny when I told her she showed me something that pulled me out of a dark place. I just wasn’t sure what exactly it was she showed me apart from another sense of hope that rose and fell by the day since I was faced with the question of my story.</p>
<p>The conversation continued as we sipped our drinks. He told me of Fritz’s promotion, of his finished college application, of some freshman on the track team that broke the previous junior varsity mile record I had set at the school. All the while, I grew more and more dissociated.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?” Hugo asked.</p>
<p>“Why would I be alright?”</p>
<p>Hugo nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m not alright, and it’s not because of our conversation. I’ve been lost, and just as I think I might have found a hint of an answer, it’s all been stripped away and I’ve been condemned to a death sentence, forced to muse on how lost I am. I’ve fallen into an abyss where the trek out seems insurmountable.”</p>
<p>“You mind if I be straight with you?”</p>
<p>“You know you don’t have to ask.”</p>
<p>“I do, actually,” he said, “because I’m not certain you’re still the same Mickey I remember talking to.”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“You told me one day that it might have been better to like a sad life than a life of nothing. You told me another day that it was better to be lost than to be blind. Then you told me that a story would fix those things. Now you have all of that.”</p>
<p>I threw up my arms. “Well, I guess I was wrong. You can say you told me so.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point, though,” he said. “The point is you went searching and found what you wanted. Maybe you were wrong, maybe not, I don’t know. What I know is that you either found what you wanted, or you learned that that wasn’t what you actually wanted. Either way, you are one step closer to solving the question that’s clearly been hurting you.”</p>
<p>Who was I to always seem to make friends with the right people? Those who understood me and weren’t afraid to nor incapable of calling me out on my nonsense when I was that myself? </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>“You doing alright?” Dad asked.</p>
<p>“I’m doing alright.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Dad said. “One month down.”</p>
<p>There is a thing I learned from running: When you are in the hardest part of the run, when all you want to do is give up, the last thing you do is start counting time. As soon as you do that, each step becomes its own hurdle, and then your run is splintered into ten thousand small hurdles that put together seem impossible to overcome. The answer? I don’t believe there was one other than to just stop thinking about it. </p>
<p>People generally label that stuff as anxiety, and then because anxiety is bad, then that stuff is also bad. Which it is true, in a way, but it’s not bad in and of itself, only bad because its label is bad. People who say these things are also the kind of people who never put themselves in situations where anxiety is to be felt, because they have labeled those situations as anxiety-inducing and thus are bad.</p>
<p>They insist to let time dictate their lives. Time will heal their wounds and bring good fortunes as long as they keep their hands numb from sitting upon them, for if their hands are numb, they can no longer feel the sinful need to reach, a sin that is rooted deep in heart and mind.</p>
<p>I am not one of those people. I look not at how much I have left to do, but at how much I have accomplished and how much more I want to accomplish. I made it so that everything I did in my life was honed on accomplishing something—anything. In my cell? There was nothing. And once I was released? Nothing was objectively worth accomplishing. I was stuck at a dead end of an endless labyrinth.</p>
<p>Did I tell my dad any of that? Of course not, for he was one of those people. He was as cemented in his ways as any other man. To ramble about my thoughts would do nothing but land me the insanity plea, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>Oh, what the hell was I thinking? The same old thoughts, the same old thoughts.</p>
<p>“Some other good news,” he continued, “Is we’re getting ready to move this weekend. A few of the guys from the shop are going to help us get it done in no time.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re moving on,” I said, even though he was only moving on because time had dictated it so.</p>
<p>“I’ll make it up to you,” he said. “I broke my promise.”</p>
<p>“I broke my end of the promise first,” I replied. </p>
<p>“No, no, it’s not entirely your fault. I should have known. I should have raised you better.”</p>
<p>I could have argued with him as I had the last time, but I decided to drop it there.</p>
<p>“Do the guys at the shop know about me?” I asked.</p>
<p>He waved it off. “It doesn’t matter what they think.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because you don’t need their validation.”</p>
<p>“I do if I’m going to continue working there.”</p>
<p>Dad sighed. “You’re not going to be allowed to continue working there, nor do you need to, nor should you. You should focus on getting into a good university and working your way up. Don’t settle down so soon when so much opportunity is ahead of you.”</p>
<p>He knew me as well as any dad should. But he didn’t know this me—the version of me that found no point in working my way up. If there was no objective reason to do so, none that aligned with my newfound axioms, then it was not worth the trouble.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>There was only one person who could ever have kept me up all night tossing and turning in bed with a fluttering heart. Hugo had given up his in-person slot for her to visit. I was going to see her! After we had both been through so much!</p>
<p>Visitation time came. I waited. Visitation time ended.</p>
<p>Something wasn’t right. Had I got the date wrong? Had she got the date wrong? Did something come up? It didn’t matter what it was. The fact was that in all the waiting, my hands grew numb.</p>
<p>A week later, I was told I had a visitor. No mention of who. Just that time had brought someone to my doorstep.</p>
<p>I followed the guard down the aisle of booths, looking at each pane of glass in anticipation. He stopped near the end, pointed at an open chair, and left.</p>
<p>When I got to the booth and saw who it was on the other side, I must say there are but few times in my life where I have been as excited. I smiled big; she scanned my gray jumpsuit and winced.</p>
<p>I picked up the phone and put it to my ear. She brought hers to hers.</p>
<p>“Hey, how are you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m okay,” she said, and before I could get another word in, she urgently continued, “Look, I don’t think I can do this.”</p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p>“This,” she said, motioning all around her.</p>
<p>“We can schedule a time without the glass--”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>She peered over her shoulders and pulled the chair closer. Her voice was low. She was shy to be talking to me. “I care about you. I really do. But I care about the you that I remember. Sitting here, it’s like you’re someone I don’t know and have been told to not trust. You’re someone I’m scared to be around.”</p>
<p>“How could you say that?” I sputtered. “It wasn’t but the last time I saw you that you hated hearing the same words spoken to you?”</p>
<p>She looked off to the side. She shifted in her seat.</p>
<p>“I know that can’t be the reason,” I said. “Please tell me, why?”</p>
<p>“It’s everything,” she said, still unable to look me in the eye. “It’s impossible to even hold a friendship when I can only see you once a month. I have so much stuff going on in my life. And you know how everyone is going to see me, if I were to be with you?”</p>
<p>“Fuck them. You don’t need their validation. It’s about you. You and me.”</p>
<p>“Is it selfish to say I don’t want to be ostracized by everyone I know for kissing a boy that’s currently in prison? I already have enough trouble.” Only then did she look at me again. “I’m sorry. I just don’t have it in me.”</p>
<p>She hung the phone back on its hook and rose from her chair.</p>
<p>“Wait!” I yelled, hitting the glass. “Please just give me one minute! Please don’t go!”</p>
<p>She never turned back. </p>
<p>The guard pulled me away from the booth and shoved me off.</p>
<p>And like that, some part of my love for her vanished. The concept of her, the girl that I knew, was as lost to me as I was to her. Some part of her had died beneath our bloody hands death gripped around her neck. We murderers who tore the leaves of the wilting tree if but for our own lackadaisical fun. There was no getting back that spark. It was a loss of innocence. A perspective predicated upon her that couldn’t be willed out of existence.</p>
<p>And like that, some part of my love for her vanished. The concept of her, the girl that I knew, was as lost to me as I was to her. She had died in our lust for hatred, our bloody hands clenched around the razor that made the blood flow around the soles of our shoes</p>
<p>But my love for her had not completely vanished. How was that so? How could I love a girl I hated and would never get back? That which kept my hand reached out for hers, banging on the glass for her to open her eyes, was of a part of my soul that I did not know or understand.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Hugo took his spot back for the month when he found out it hadn’t been used. When the guard let him in, he smiled directly at our spot, and winced beneath his smile upon seeing me. He stopped by the coffee machine, slid a bill into it, and placed a cup beneath its sprout. While it brewed, he slid a bill into the adjacent vending machine and typed in the code for Oreos.</p>
<p>Had he also worried what others thought about him visiting me in prison? Did they know he visited me, or did they presume it whether he did or not? Did he even care?</p>
<p>“You look worse than last time,” he said, tossing the Oreos at my chest and setting the coffee in front of me. “What happened?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you already know,” I said.</p>
<p>“Only from rumors.”</p>
<p>“What do they say?”</p>
<p>“Nothing important.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on, you’re not my dad. Be real and tell me.”</p>
<p>Hugo scratched the back of his head. He was hesitating. I could sense hesitation from a mile away. “Rumor is that you’re the reason Jenny was out for a couple of weeks. And that Jenny came up here to break things off with you and in response you wept like a baby.”</p>
<p>“That’s hardly true,” I said, because it being truer than I was comfortable with.</p>
<p>“Hence why I said it’s not important. But you insisted regardless…” he looked me up and down and shook his head. “Honestly Mickey, what the hell? Why do you look like this? Why are you acting like this?”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“You’ve given up!” he proclaimed. “I hate to say it, but you’re pathetic. You’ve become the most miserable, loathsome person I know, and you whine without any effort to show. What happened to all that pursuit of truth?”</p>
<p>“Where is there effort to give? And what for?”</p>
<p>Hugo slid to the edge of his seat. “What happened to the Mickey that I remember, who pursued what he believed in no matter what people thought about him, no matter where it might’ve brought him, no matter what the situation he was in?”</p>
<p>“You’ve misunderstood me then,” I said. “I only ever did anything because I had dreams I wanted to accomplish. But my dreams are gone! And not only are they gone, but they are meaningless even if they weren’t. I’m never going to get into Valencia. And how can I dream dreams that are only good because I am better than everyone else? I’m never going to get her back, and how can I ever dream of finding someone like her again in the position I’m in? Everything I want is but a primal byproduct of the biological computer I’m in, their meaning entirely dependent upon simple chemical reactions. How can I ever dream again?”</p>
