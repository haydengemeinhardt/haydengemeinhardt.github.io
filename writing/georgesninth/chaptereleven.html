<p>“I still can’t believe you guys have an auditorium,” Hugo said as we followed the tail end of the class line, squeezing into the eighth row a comfortable distance from the stage.</p><p>“You’re starting to sound a lot like me,” I replied.</p><p>“I’m not complaining. I meant to say I can’t believe my school didn’t have an auditorium. Even the ancient Greeks had this. You were awake that class, right?”</p><p>The line stopped. I pulled down the seat cushion and sat. “Where did you hold guest speakers then?”</p><p>“The gym like everyone else,” Hugo said. “Or football field. Depending on the occasion. Although, I don’t know how they decided.”</p><p>“They save the boring stuff for the auditorium.”</p><p>“What, you don’t like speeches?”</p><p>“It’s a talk, not a speech,” I said. “A talk is matter-of-the-fact. A speech gets you excited to take on the world—but not everyone wants that. So at some point, someone decided these should be two separate things and saved one for the football field and the other for here. It’s the great lie I say!”</p><p>Hugo raised an eyebrow, but facing the stage such that it was only meant as a gesture to himself, then lowered it before glancing back at me. “Well, he’s gotten me out of class multiple times, so that’s gotta count for something.”</p><p>“Wait, you had him too?”</p><p>“Every year,” Hugo said.</p><p>“Huh. Who else did you have? Did you have that one C-teir actor? She was pretty interesting. I forgot her name though.”</p><p>“The fuck are you talking about?”</p><p>“Or the NFL team?”</p><p>“No, but we got the sheriff.”</p><p>“Can’t say we’ve had him. Principal Fritz doesn’t like cops on school grounds.”</p><p>“You guys probably got the SEC or some shit, huh?”</p><p>“I wish,” I said, immediately regretting the words that slipped my mouth. It tasted of spite.</p><p>A row filed in behind us. It was a silent class, the type where no one in there is really friends and no one bothers to make new ones because we’re already established with the group we got and on edge of leaving anyway. With the silence brought a pause in our conversation, because then everyone could hear our words and judge us and we didn’t want to deal with our words being judged by anyone but ourselves. But why not? Was I afraid? </p><p>“Do you ever want to give a speech yourself?”</p><p>Hugo sighed and shifted in his seat. “I guess we’ll have to address the elephant in the room then. How hard did Megan fuck you last night? Because I don’t know who you are.”</p><p>I rolled my eyes. “It’s a genuine question. Do you think you could change people’s lives for the better if you were only given an hour? Because it’s hard to get people to care for more than an hour, but if it takes longer what hope do we have of bettering ourselves?”</p><p>“Nope, there you are,” Hugo said, and in that Hugo recognized me, I felt ashamed. “This speech—talk—has taught me before. I bet if you put aside your differences and genuinely listen as though there was something he knew that you didn’t—which is likely to be true—then you would too. But if you’re too spiteful, too weak to overcome it, what hope do you have?”</p><p>And I felt weak, the same feeling that lurked in my bones for months. So I was determined to listen to the talk. But what was the difference between valuing strength and valuing wealth, good looks, physical strength? Such was the question that silently began its haunting of me. It wasn’t meant to be contemplated in that place at that time though, as I knew it held a much deeper truth to it than I could think it to have. I could only value strength in juxtaposition to its opposite: a person who is strong requires more to make themselves happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than of an inferior type; but in spite of those liabilities, they can never really wish to sink into what they feel to be a lower grade of existence.*</p><p>“Look who it is,” Hugo said, looking past my silence, down the aisle at Megan, who had snuck out of her own class line.</p><p>She shuffled her way through the row and sat on the edge of the seat next to mine. Her knees were turned to me, her hands folded in her lap, and her eyes perked to mine as though she had the most important thing to say to me. “You know what I just found out, Mickey?” she asked. </p><p>I shook my head. </p><p>“That you were good friends with Jenny.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah,” I said, glancing back toward the stage anticipating the start. “We were for a while.”</p><p>A man walked out and waited for the last lines of people to find their seats. He looked awfully strange, though, as he stood there in his suit and scanned the crowd. He was the man I saw at the Grand Plaza, walking past the water show as he gazed at everyone else instead. His eyes settled on us for a moment before flicking away.</p><p>“Was that Mr. Grayson we saw?” I asked Hugo, leaning on his armrest, wondering if he thought about the same thing as me.</p><p>“I invited her to my party,” Megan continued, still facing me. “You know, the one you’re coming to.”</p><p>“Who?” I asked, looking over the side of my shoulder at Megan.</p><p>“Jenny. J-e-n--”</p><p>“Oh, right.”</p><p>The projector lit up. Mr. Grayson tapped the microphone and introduced himself. Hugo was immersed alongside the crowd while Megan rocked in her seat.</p><p>“Throughout all of human history,” Mr. Grayson spoke, his voicing echoing through the auditorium, “there are countless tales of monks and philosophers forgoing money for virtue. One such man was named Diogenes. He was caught forging coins and was stripped of his citizenship and property. But then he embraced poverty and preached renunciation of unnecessities in life. He lived in a barrel and even so much as threw his cup away when he saw kids drink from their hands. When Alexander the Great, king of western civilization, approached him and said he would offer him anything thing he wanted, Diogenes asked him to stand out of my sunlight—”</p><p>“Why did you stop talking to Jenny?” Megan asked quietly. “I get the whole George thing, but don’t you think she needed a friend as much as you?”</p><p>“That’s a hell of a question to ask in a place like this,” I whispered back. “We just don’t talk anymore.”</p><p>“Well, I’m interested.” Her eyes were wholly fixed on mine. Her posture was orthogonal to the stage. I doubted she had listened to a word of the speech that was being given before us.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you be more interested in your future?” I motioned towards Mr. Grayson.</p><p>“I’ve heard the speech before,” Megan muttered and looked away.</p><p>“The reason I put forward those who appear to mock what I advocate is because they teach us the most fundamental fact about financial responsibility—that it is imperative you keep your indulgence in check. I cannot tell you how many prodigal young adults I’ve come across in my life who blow an inheritance away in their youth…”</p><p>Megan nudged my arm. “Are you going to answer the question?”</p><p>I sighed and stretched my legs out. “Jenny and I only really had George and work in common. So when she quit her job, we had nothing to talk about. That’s all, really.”</p><p>“I do not say forgo luxury,” Mr. Grayson continued, changing to the next slide covered with pictures of people on vacation, “I want you to travel the world, but I want you to be able to return with savings and retirement plans intact—”</p><p>“There was no fighting?” Megan asked.</p><p>“Did you want there to be?”</p><p>“You don’t seem to be the type of guy to let go of something good without a reason.”</p><p>Mr. Grayson’s words were lost to me by then. Much like in class, if something steals one’s attention for but a moment, the material becomes a mystery and compounds into the rest of the year. If we were in class, I would’ve paid Megan no further attention. But I was only listening to the talk because Hugo told me to, and Megan gained a hint of my respect in that auditorium—her persistent questioning, line of reasoning, and genuine curiosity showed there was more to her than I thought, for those were traits of an interesting person. So I tucked the talk away, mirrored my knees with hers, and cupped her cold hands. She deserved to know who I came to be from the person she knew in school years prior.</p><p>“I’ve learned a lot the last couple of months,” I spoke. She shyly retreated her hands, but I held them and pulled them back. “I learned that the world was not the place I thought it to be and that I was not the person I thought I was, and every moment I was finding out something awful about one of the two. In that, my heart dragged. I valued in life that which made my heart race, but my heart dragged. Then you came to me and held out your hand. But what did I do? I spat on it. I didn’t want to take it because I despised all that made us people, yet you grabbed my hand anyway. You forced a challenge upon me that I could not refuse. You forced a spark of life into me that I had not felt in a long time. Because of you, my world looked hopeful once more...”</p><p>Megan yanked her hands from mine. She rose from her seat, shuffled down of the aisle, and marched out of the auditorium. </p><p>I was left dumbfounded. What did I say? Oh, who was I kidding! I was clinging onto her like a hedonistic indulgence, as a lover of fine art and wine. What an ordeal it was to become so spiteful to the world such that I found the footing on my path slippery and ended up slipping through thorny bushes that hid paths I hadn’t known existed, only becoming aware when it came time to pluck the thorns from my skin and watch the blood drip into the earth. It felt like a curse, an unendurable curse of a wish beset upon me: a wish that I was ruler of the world and had all the money of the world to bring about the world of Eden—to be a king, a god, a bearer of the crown of thorns—so George, Lucas, and I could still be together blindly fumbling through life.</p><p>An unusual pause in the background noise that was the talk returned my attention to the stage. Mr. Grayson darted his gaze to the other half of the auditorium and resumed echoing his words.</p><p>“It is important to remember that time is money and money is time. You may be okay working ten extra hours to purchase a luxury that costs ten hours worth of work, but you may not have ten hours to spare. Likewise, spending fifteen extra minutes to save a dollar is probably not worth your time either. Balancing these two ideas is a key factor not only in financial success but also a healthy lifestyle.”</p><p>The projector flicked to the next slide. Mr. Grayson rattled along. I told Hugo I would listen to the talk. I was glad I didn’t promise. It was impossible to not let my mind wander, wondering how I was going to reconcile with Megan, or if I even should.</p><p>--</p><p>At the end of the speech, Mr. Grayson held time for those of us with questions to talk to him one-on-one as everyone else made their way back to class. I happened to have a question of my own for him and pushed my way past the exiting crowd on their way to lunch. Although Mr. Grayson said he welcomed everyone’s questions, I didn’t think he expected anyone to actually walk up and ask, because when I stepped up on the stage, he looked confused as to what I was doing.</p><p>“Hello,” I said, shaking his hand, “I’m Mickey.”</p><p>“Hello Mickey, how may I help you?”</p><p>“You fund the afterschool group counseling program here, right?”</p><p>He nodded. “Indeed, I do.”</p><p>“Why is that? I mean, why this school? Why not other schools?”</p><p>I wasn’t sure what response I was expecting. Maybe a slightly more confused look than he had when I first approached him. Perhaps a pondering sigh. All he did was laugh when he realized I was on stage to ask a question, because everybody had to laugh at Mickey Lee’s questions at least one point in their life. </p><p>“Every school in the county has the program,” he said, “not just this one.”</p><p>“But why this school?”</p><p>“Why not this school?”</p><p>“Do you not see the difference when you present in an auditorium or a gym?”</p><p>“Oh, I see,” he said, raising his hand to his chin, his shiny watch peaking from under his sleeve. “Hardly. I see a room of seventeen, eighteen, and maybe nineteen year old kids who are all equally lost in life. Some are hoping to get into great colleges, others are planning on continuing their minimum wage job. I see a room of varying proportions of kids taking notes. But in the end, there are problems beyond finances, and if there is no support, no matter what that reason may be, I want to be able to provide it.”</p><p>To arrive at such a mass of wealth as his, one thinks every decision through to a detail. He had to of carefully tread his path, sworn to it under immense discipline as instinctual to his own mind as himself. He wouldn’t do something unless it was worth his time and attention. Was answering my question not worth either? It must’ve been what Hugo and Megan felt, deserving and demanding of an answer that was more than a cookie-cutter response. </p><p>“You say there are problems beyond finances,” I pressed, “yet here you are throwing money at the problems.”</p><p>“That I am.”</p><p>“You know it to be true, then, that it is better for someone to be lost in a rich man’s house than dark streets?”</p><p>“I can’t argue against that.”</p><p>“Then why do you give money to the rich man?”</p><p>He paused. Not a “he got me” pause, but a “should I divulge more?” pause. Then, he lowered his voice and put his hand on my shoulder. “Because sometimes, that rich man doesn’t know what to spend his money on for those he is responsible for and is too stubborn to accept otherwise.”</p><p>It was a genuine answer. Yet, it was clear he truly had no idea why he was doing what he was doing. They say the older one gets, the more they realize no one knows what they are doing. I considered myself young, but if the world was as lost as this guy, and they were only to appear more lost as I aged, how lost was the world? I almost didn’t want to know the answer to the question and left the lost man on stage to remain lost myself</p><p>But, of course, I needed the answer, and was instead forced off-stage by a teacher who didn’t want me up there because the bell had rung to go to next period and it didn’t matter that next period was lunch. I doubted that teacher knew why she was doing what she was doing either, as I couldn’t find a reason why she needed to enforce her power like that—an inability to compartmentalize, a lack of self-esteem, a need for others to think and do the same things she does? I couldn’t tell which.</p><p>Hugo was waiting for me in the hallway with a tray of lunch already in his hands, chatting with one of his friends. When he saw me, he dapped him off and joined me on my walk to our table.</p><p>“So,” Hugo said, squeezing past someone to join my side, “you learn anything?”</p><p>“I can’t really recall anything that was said.”</p><p>“Doesn’t mean you didn’t learn anything,” Hugo said. “Just means you’d fail the test.”</p><p>We split to go around a group standing in the middle of the hall and rejoined on the other side.</p><p>“Then I guess I didn’t learn enough.”</p><p>“That’s between you and how much you care about that test grade.”</p><p>We pushed into the covered courtyard through the double doors that constrained most of the crowd inside. Those outside were already sitting, taking up almost all the tables but ours on the edge. Hugo and I skirted the courtyard and took our seats. I tossed my backpack on the unoccupied, rubber-grilled spot next to me. Hugo twisted his orange juice open and took a sweet sip with a subsequent smile</p><p>“I thought the talk was interesting at least,” Hugo said. “Especially that bit about Diogenes. Although, I don’t know what it had to do with the rest of what he said.”</p><p>“Nothing,” I replied. “It was just a cheap trick to get people’s attention, like banging on pots and pans or removing a muffler. It’s easy to see through once you’ve done it yourself.”</p><p>“As in you’ve done it yourself?” Hugo asked, then began to chug his orange juice.</p><p>“I was told to start off my college application with a hook, so I’d overcompensate by taking up a third of the essay quoting and writing about someone else doing something interesting instead of just doing something interesting myself and writing about that. Are you okay?”</p><p>Hugo was clenching his forehead in pain. “Sorry, brain freeze… uh, why not just write about yourself?”</p><p>“That’s the thing” I said, trying to distract him from his pain, although I wasn’t sure he listened to what I had explained. “I haven’t done anything interesting. There’s no story to my life that makes me, me. Nothing that makes me unique. I’m just like everyone else.”</p><p>“Hardly!” Hugo laughed.  “And either way, lives can’t just be narrowed down to one event like you seem to think. People are an intricate web of all the things they know have ever happened.” He regained his posture and put the cap back on his drink, then began digging into the school’s excuse of a lunch—a single large slice of pizza that, in comparison to his first bite, could be finished in six. I could’ve eaten eight of them when I ran.</p><p>“What does your application look like?” I asked.</p><p>He licked a smear of red sauce from his lips. “I’m not applying to college.”</p><p>“Oh, why not?”</p><p>He shrugged, took another bite, and said with a mouthful, “You know I don’t have the money for college.”</p><p>“There’s scholarships.”</p><p>“And I don’t have the grades for that.”</p><p>“What? Really?”</p><p>He swallowed and nodded. “What I do have is a hard time caring about school.”</p><p>“Tell me then,” I said, unzipping my backpack and pulling out a plastic-wrapped sandwich,  “other than your insatiable desire for orange juice, what do you care about?”</p><p>“My friends, my family, someone I really like. The usual.” He sucked the grease from the tips of his fingers and wrestled with a paper towel, then reached for a plastic spoon for a scoop of corn. “By the way, what happened between you and Megan earlier? Was it about that elephant?”</p><p>“Something like that,” I said. I unwrapped my sandwich and took a large bite to excuse myself from having to divulge anything further. </p><p>“Well, good luck with it,” Hugo said. “You don’t have any classes with her, do you?”</p><p>“Not this year.”</p><p>“Right, that’s because she’s stuck in Mrs. Shirley’s class with me!” He smacked the table and laughed in remembering. “Mrs. Shirley, what a mouthful she is. You know, last week she gave us a test and, when we were going over the answers this week in class, half of her answer sheet was wrong! How does a teacher expect students to ace their test in an hour when the teacher with a life of experience and no time limit fails their own test? And instead of just fixing her answer sheet, we now all have to retake a different version of the test!”</p><p>Hugo finished his pizza in five eager bites, leaving him the rest of the hour to gossip while I nibbled on my sandwich and nodded. Soon, the bell rang, we flung on our backpacks, tossed our trash, and separated, and I made my way through the hall to Mrs. Rupert’s chemistry class, waving hi to old friends and classmates of years past.</p><p>The courtyard was on the opposite side of the school as my class, so by the time I arrived, the only people not in class were those that weren’t going to show up to last minute anyway. I wasn’t sure when Lucas became one of those people, but his desk catercorner to mine was empty. I thought we were lucky to have our desks as close together as we did at the beginning of the year. Those days, it was just awkward.</p><p>He walked in as the bell rang and we smiled and nodded to each other as friends do. Mrs. Rupert closed the door behind him. As she returned to the center of the room, the room hushed to a whisper.</p><p>“We’re done talking about atomic structure,” Mrs. Rupert said, and everyone heaved a sigh of relief. “To wrap up the unit, there will be a short homework assignment due Friday and a test on Monday. You can find the details on the course page later tonight.” She powered on the projector and then leaned over her laptop as she ran her finger across the mousepad. She clicked and looked back at the projector screen until the powerpoint appeared. “We’re going to be shifting into the chemical nomenclature over these next couple of weeks,” she said, and the following title slide appeared, and everyone groaned.</p><p>--</p><p>“It’s about building skills and being exposed to different fields,” Bobby said at the shop later in the afternoon. The same cookiecutter response that anyone who didn’t know better touted. When was he going to start respecting my questions?</p><p>“No offense Bobby...”</p><p>“But?”</p><p>“But what skills does chemistry build for being a mechanic?” I asked.</p><p>“It’s more complicated than that,” Bobby said. “Being able to ask the right questions and being able to find answers to the questions—which is more than just asking the questions, and more than coming to ask me for the answer—requires an understanding of the world you exist in: it’s language, history, chemistry, engineering. Knowledge is more than facts, and it generally leads to the betterment of everyone in the society that values it. That is why you learn the things you do in school.”</p><p>There was a time where I believed the more complex shape of the cookies meant the truer the answer. Did the tests in class measure the gain in ones knowledge? Was it a measure of that substance called knowledge, that jumbled web of all the things that ever happened, or was I simply evaluated on my ability to remember? Hence, the problem: our validation, our value and self-worth as students, was placed in knowledge then measured by and granted in proportion to our scores on faulty examinations of memorization. </p><p>I was forced to forgive those who forced the tests upon me, for I found no alternative. It seemed that knowledge could only truly be measured in the same way as happiness, courage, empathy, or right or wrong. How does one measure that which has no metric by which to quantify it? I might attest that such a thing exists. I might indeed revel in the intelligible world which is still left to me; but even though I have an idea of it, which has its good grounds, yet I have not the least cognizance of it nor can I ever attain this.* I was deaf, amputated, and orphaned all along, just in the least interesting manner—I had unknowingly tossed my values into the incognizant void and let its puppeteer twiddle the strings of my enigmatic heart. But I knew there was still something more I was unaware of.</p>
