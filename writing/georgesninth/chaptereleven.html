<p>“I still can’t believe you guys have an auditorium,” Hugo said as we followed our class line from the tail-end to our seats, squeezing into the fourth row from the stage.</p>
<p>“Something, something, embrace the bears,” I replied. The line in front of us stopped. We pulled down the seat cushion and sat. “Where did you guys hold guest speakers?”</p>
<p>“In the gym like everyone else.”</p>
<p>“And did you have the same guest speakers?”</p>
<p>“Well, I think we had this same guy actually.”</p>
<p>This same guy gave a speech every year to the seniors of TRHS—and others apparently—about financial responsibility. He wasn’t a motivational speaker by trade, though. He was owner of Grayson Reality, owner of the Grand Plaza, and a benefactor to the school—namely his funding of an afterschool group counseling program, which puzzled me in many ways.</p>
<p>“How about that C-tier actor?” I asked. “She was pretty interesting. I forget her name though.”</p>
<p>“The fuck are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Or that NFL team?”</p>
<p>Hugo shook his head and sighed. “No, we got people like the sheriff.”</p>
<p>I muffled a sputtering laugh. “Can’t say we’ve had him. Principal Fritz doesn’t like cops on campus.”</p>
<p>“The sheriff is a cool guy and all, but they don’t come after you people. You guys probably got the SEC or some shit, huh?”</p>
<p>“I wish that were so.”</p>
<p>“Oh, look who it is,” Hugo said, looking past me, down the aisle at Megan, who apparently was ditching her own class line. </p>
<p>She shuffled her way through the row and sat on the edge of the seat next to mine. Her knees were turned to me, and her eyes perked to mine as though she had the most important thing to say to me. “You know what I just found out, Mickey?” She asked. I shook my head. “That you were good friends with Jenny.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah,” I said, turning my gaze back toward the stage. “We were for a while.”</p>
<p>A man had walked out and waited for the last lines of people to find their seats. He looked awfully strange, though, as he stood there in his suit and scanned the crowd. He was the man I saw at the Grand Plaza, walking past the water show as he gazed at everyone else instead. His eyes settled on us for a moment before flicking away.</p>
<p>“Is that Mr. Grayson?” I asked, wondering if Hugo thought about the same thing as me.</p>
<p>“I invited her to my party,” Megan continued, still facing me. “You know, the one you’re coming to.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Jenny. J-e-n--”</p>
<p>“Oh, right.” I was unsure if Jenny’s presence at the party would make me more or less hesitant to go. Still, I knew I wasn’t actually going to miss Megan’s party despite the teasing I kept up. Not after what happened last night.</p>
<p>The projector lit up. Mr. Grayson tapped the microphone and introduced himself. Hugo became fully immersed with the crowd while Megan rocked in her seat. I settled in, ready to wait out the hour as I was trained to do hour by hour, day by day at this place.</p>
<p>“Throughout all of human history,” Mr. Grayson spoke, “there are countless tales of monks and philosophers forgoing money for virtue. One such man was named Diogenes. He was caught forging coins and was stripped of his citizenship and property. But then he embraced poverty and preached the renunciation of the unnecessities in life. He lived in a barrel and even so much as threw his cup away when he saw kids drink from their hands. When Alexander the Great, king of western civilization, approached him and said he would offer him anything thing he wanted, Diogenes insultingly said ‘stand out of my sunlight’...”</p>
<p>“Why did you stop talking to Jenny?” Megan quietly asked. “I get the whole George thing, but don’t you think she needed a friend as much as you?”</p>
<p>“That’s a hell of a question to ask in a place like this,” I whispered back, although I was expecting the </p>
<p>“Well, I’m interested.” Her eyes were wholly fixed on mine. Her posture was orthogonal to the stage. I doubted she had listened to a word of the speech that was being given before us.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t you be more interested in your future?”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the speech before,” Megan muttered then looked away.</p>
<p>I turned my attention back to Mr. Grayson. “The reason I put forward those who appear to mock what I advocate is because they teach us the most fundamental fact about financial responsibility—that it is imperative you keep your indulgence in check. I cannot tell you how many prodigal young adults I’ve come across in my life who blow an inheritance away in their youth…”</p>
<p>Megan nudged my arm. “Are you going to answer the question?”</p>
<p>I sighed and stretched my legs out. “Jenny and I only really had George and work in common. So when she quit her job, we had nothing to talk about. That’s all, really.”</p>
<p>“I do not say forgo luxury,” Mr. Grayson continued, “I want you to travel the world, but I want you to be able to return with savings and retirement plans intact…”</p>
<p>“There was no fighting?” Megan asked.</p>
<p>“Did you want there to be?”</p>
<p>“You don’t seem to be the type of guy to let go of something good without a reason.”</p>
<p>She just wasn’t letting up. Not without a thought out response. I was annoyed, but I also realized I owed her an answer. A genuine answer. One that I had pondered upon at night, restless in bed. “I learned a lot the last couple of months,” I replied. “I learned that the world was not the place I thought it to be and that I was not the person I thought I was. It felt like every moment, I looked back on my past self and wished I was a better person. But in that, George taught me to stop looking back but to look at my future self, moment by moment, and to take great care in doing so, so that I may know my regrets before I make them, and to defend my dignity, so that my dignity will never let those oncoming regrets walk over me as they try to pass me by, much as they try to do so now.” </p>
<p>I cupped her hands in mine.  The rest of my words were to come from my heart, as I had not yet had the opportunity to lie down and stare at the ceiling between her kiss and this moment. I had only the unprocessed revelation from that house to guide me. “You taught me something else that night. While my best friend’s death opened my eyes to the pain in the world, you forced a spark of life into me that I had not felt since then. That contrasted against my newfound vision was inexplicitly beautiful. Once I understood everything that went into making a kind and just and loving soul, I stopped seeing you as just oil on canvas but as a work of art. And along with that, all the other beautiful things in this world sprouted. Because of you, my world looks hopeful once more--”</p>
<p>Megan pulled her hands from mine, rose from her seat, and shuffled down the aisle and out of the auditorium. I was left dumbfounded in her absence. Had I said something wrong? Did she not want me to think of her that way?</p>
<p>Oh, who was I kidding? I was clinging onto her like some hedonistic indulgence. What an ordeal it is to become so spiteful to the world such that in my turn out of whine, I find the footing on my path slippery, and I end up slipping through thorny bushes and down paths I hadn’t known existed. It felt like a curse, an unendurable curse of a wish beset upon me. A wish that I was the ruler of the world and had all the money necessary to make sure this never happened, so that Lucas, George, and I would still be together fumbling blindly through life.</p>
<p>I think everyone wished at some point that they had enough money to live in a world of Eden. But to truly crave it and desire it seemed to be reserved only for the worst of us, which made me wonder if it was a wish worth it at all.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>At the end of the speech, Mr. Grayson held time for those of us with questions to talk to him one-on-one as everyone else made their way back to class. I happened to have a question of my own for him and pushed my way through the crowd. </p>
<p>Had it been a couple of months earlier, I would not have approached him. Now, I thought “what would George do?”—not that George would have this particular question, but that George would seek an answer to his questions for the sake of finding an answer.</p>
<p>When Mr. Grayson welcomed everyone’s questions, I don’t think he expected anyone to actually walk up and ask him one, because as I stepped up on stage, he looked rather confused.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m Mickey.” I shook his hand.</p>
<p>“Hello Mickey, how may I help you?”</p>
<p>“You fund the afterschool group counseling program here, right?”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Indeed, I do.”</p>
<p>“Why is that? I mean, why this school? Why not other schools?”</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what response I was expecting. Maybe a slightly more confused look than he did when I first approached him. Perhaps a vexation. All he did was laugh. “Every school in the county has the program. Not just this one.”</p>
<p>“But why this school?”</p>
<p>“Why not this school?”</p>
<p>“Do you not see the difference when you present in an auditorium or a gym?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see,” he said, raising his hand to his chin. “Hardly. I see a room of seventeen, eighteen, and maybe nineteen year old kids who are all equally lost in life. Some are hoping to get into great colleges, others are planning on continuing their minimum wage job. I see a room of varying proportions of kids taking notes. But in the end, there are problems beyond finances, and if there is no support, no matter what that reason may be, I want to be able to provide it.”</p>
<p>It was a cookie-cutter response. Either he hadn’t thought it through, or he thought me just another foolish kid. I was used to the latter, but the former pissed me off. To arrive at such a mass of wealth as his, one thinks every decision through to a detail. He had to of carefully treaded his path, sworn to it under the greatest of psychological disciplines, like an animalistic survival instinct as innate to his own mind as himself. He wouldn’t do something unless it was worth his time and attention.</p>
<p>“You say there are problems beyond finances, yet here you are throwing money at the problems.”</p>
<p>“That I am.”</p>
<p>“You know it to be true, then, that it is better for one to be lost in a rich man’s comforting home than empty, dark streets?”</p>
<p>“I can’t argue against that.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you give money to the rich man?”</p>
<p>He paused. Not an ‘he got me’ pause, but a ‘should I divulge more’ pause. Then, he lowered his voice and put his hand on my shoulder. “Because sometimes, that rich man doesn’t know what to spend his money on for those he is responsible for and is too stubborn to accept otherwise.”</p>
