<p>I expected screaming. I received dumbfounded silence from the middle-aged couple on their white leather couch. Teenagers in khakis and polo shirts aren’t burglars; they are troublemakers. They are the kind an adult never fears for an adult thinks they have command for simply being an adult. Instead of the husband reaching for a baseball bat, it was the wife who thrust her hands on her hips and crooked her head, eyebrows raised high. She was right—few people in all of Newport could catch me with a baseball bat, but the silent stare of shame was like a branding iron. I quickly rummaged through the piles of coats on the hooks to retrieve the buried jacket which still carried my phone. Then I apologized and walked out.</p>
<p>Bringing Megan there was a bad, bad idea. She never dreamed of the magical house; she said she never dreamed at all! I hadn’t given her a story, I told her one, of which staying in the parking lot would have sufficed. But my story was not a story that could be told. It was an incomprehensible story where each turn was psychotic. It was the paradox which plagued me—she needed to have come down the path naturally and on her own to understand the parts where wanderers might’ve gotten confused and went the wrong way, leading to a cascade of worse and worse decisions until they were so far off the well-tread path that finding it again was hopeless. </p>
<p>As such, Megan did not talk to me on Tuesday. Nor did she on Wednesday, nor Thursday, nor Friday. She sat with her old friends while Hugo sat sick at home. So I sat alone with my thoughts all week. Then the weekend came and thrust me in the passenger’s seat of Bobby’s truck, where my thoughts could not stay still any longer.</p>
<p>The truck sputtered up New River Bridge with tools and parts rattling in the back and fastened in the bed. Its heater poured warmth onto my skin while the godforsaken jacket layed on my lap. It was a chilly morning, but the sun was bright, the sky was clear, and the wind was still. </p>
<p>Bobby’s morning talk show robbed the ride of its peace. The hosts were good people, I presumed, but their mics were tuned so their words tickled my ears, so I despised them. It did not help that Bobby kept the volume loud enough to inflict hearing damage. It was time to negotiate turning it down. Or off.</p>
<p>“Do you want to live forever?” I asked. </p>
<p>Bobby groaned and rubbed his temple.  “No, I don’t want to live forever.” </p>
<p>“But you don’t want to die, right?”</p>
<p>“Are we doing this again?” He pulled down the shade and maneuvered it to block the sun from the driver side window. </p>
<p>“Just for the ride there,” I said.</p>
<p>He reached for the knob to quiet the radio. My ears sighed with relief. </p>
<p>“No,” he said, “I don’t want to die.”</p>
<p>A thought popped into my head and a smirk dimpled my cheek. I formed a finger-gun and pointed it at his temple. “Good, then you’ll do as I say and answer my questions.”</p>
<p>He stared emptily ahead at the cresting of the bridge. The shadows of the bridge supports flickered behind him in sequence. I forgot adults were too serious around kids to joke with them and decided it best to move on if I wanted to keep the radio turned down.</p>
<p>I frowned and holstered my gun. “No, it’s just, I’ve been thinking lately that I don’t want to die nor do I ever see myself wanting to die. As in if there was this magical pill that’d extend my life, I’d see myself taking it indefinitely. No one I’ve talked to wants to die. But I’m the only one that wants to live forever. It’s a contradiction, and I at least know contradictions are wrong.”</p>
<p>“Why do you care so much about what others think?” Bobby asked. “If you want to live forever, then good for you.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you care?” I blurted.  “That has always been my problem–nobody cares as much as I’d like them to about the things I’d like them to care about.”</p>
<p>“Don’t we all?” Bobby said. “But I think that’s a good thing. If everyone only cared about one thing at a time, nothing would get done, and if everyone agreed on what to do about it, there would be no room for mistakes.”</p>
<p>“I’m not talking about politics. I’m talking about what’s beyond that. The things that actually make life worth living–passion, love, dreams. Yet all I see is passion for hate and love for complacency. Can you believe I’m not surprised no one wants to live forever?”</p>
<p>Bobby scratched his chin. “You know, you’ve talked on and on about how you wish people were less complacent, less animalistic, yet here you are wanting to live forever.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you see the contradiction?”</p>
<p>“Oh.” </p>
<p>“I don’t mean to say you shouldn't want what you clearly want. I just think the things you’re badgering others for are abundant in yourself as well, much more than you realize.”</p>
<p>I slumped back and looked out my window. The bridge transitioned down onto land where buildings rose above us again. In a small square of concrete and benches gathered almost a dozen guys in working clothes laughing, smoking, and waving down the occasional truck-and-trailer. A number of the storefronts read “closed” for the weekend while an equal number were teeming with filled parking lots. The area was familiar. The sense of a hometown stretched into it, marked by a period of constant wrongness.</p>
<p>Bobby broke the silence. “Do you know why I insist you come with me every Sunday?”</p>
<p>“You said it was because you needed help,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing this longer than you’ve been alive,” he replied. “You are a mighty help, but I’m not that old yet. It’s not why I make you come along. In fact, it wasn’t really my decision.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Your father was the one that suggested you come along.”</p>
<p>“My dad?”</p>
<p>He nodded. “And it wasn’t to get you away from Jenny,” he joked.</p>
<p>“We’re not a thing.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care either way.”</p>
<p>“Why would he want me to go with you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The same reasons that any father would. To teach you financial responsibility, social relationships, a hint of the world after school, but also that lending an ear or a helping hand is often more than what money could buy. At least, that’s what I believe, and I remember it was quite a topic of discussion for us. Lately, though, I think that it is equally important that you understand it’s not wrong to ask for an ear or a hand.”</p>
<p>“Is this about George?”</p>
<p>“Who’s George?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nevermind.”</p>
<p>“I’m serious,” Bobby said, and for the first time all morning, he took his eyes off the road and looked at me. “Do you need help?”</p>
<p>It was as though he had asked Don’t you want to be more like Lucas? upon which the answer was most certainly “Not at all.”</p>
<p>Bobby nodded in content and returned his attention to the road, reaching to turn back up the radio. </p>
<p>I couldn’t think. The atmosphere didn’t allow it. The obnoxious laughter of the talk show hosts assaulted my ears while the truck thrust my body back and forth in stop and go traffic. It wasn’t until we arrived in the quiet driveway that I could think.</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>Hot steam permeated from the shower, placing me amidst a rising cloud encapsulated by glass walls. Steam stuck to the glass, blind like a bird. Steam circulated into my cold lungs and softened the phlegm built over the run—I hacked and spit into the drain. In waves, steam crashed against the ceiling and dispersed overhead, fighting to escape into the vent whose fan hummed in the background. </p>
<p>The water was like a warm blanket around my cold body, kissing the goosebumps on my arms and thawing my numb fingers. I bent beneath the shower so the water would flood the back of my head. It separated into small streams that traced my jaw and brow before clashing and plunging to the stone tile. I stood although my legs burned. I panted although my lungs stung. I sipped on the water gushing around my lips while wanting to throw it all up. The pain would cease, though the run brought no triumph. The march to war had disappeared in my head in a sedating eclipse of self-realization. </p>
<p>There was no one point where I looked down at my hands and took one step back from my body. It was a gradual shift, like the slow onset of a migraine from a hint of stress in the morning. But while migraines were washed away in sleep, as were happiness and anger, love and hate lingered. They were much deeper. They sat patiently on the edges of the bed, staring at their slumbering wielders who clutched much more tightly. The difference in grip was as the difference between a boastful proclamation made before New Year’s and a silent devotion that required no premature self-fulfilment to be made true—the very contrast upon which my hate was embedded, the lack of self-awareness I believed arose from an indifference towards life that penetrated every level of society.</p>
<p>Each time I criticized others, there was a confounding echo of an even worse faculty in myself that shouted “wrong, wrong, wrong”. In the spiteful months after the cafe, I had accumulated a deafening cacophony of wrongs, and from the cacophony emerged an underlying, endless tune in the torture chamber that was my head: If someone told me I was wrong, I might’ve still been right; If a room of people told me I was wrong, then I was most likely wrong; If I acknowledged that fact yet vehemently disagreed with everyone I crossed paths with, then I could only conclude something deeper lurked.</p>
<p>I criticized others for what I believed to be a lack of the qualities which separated humans from swine: temperance, magnificence, patience, tenacity, justice. Those which brought a harder life, yet a happier, greater life that if only people truly reached out to take, they’d have, and once taken, they’d never let go and never return to being a lesser version of themselves. A being of higher faculties requires more to make them happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type; but in spite of these liabilities, they can never really wish to sink into what they feel to be a lower grade of existence.* But there was my ultimate dilemma: which was the lower grade of existence? The one who was content with dying, or the one who wanted to live forever? I did not know, as what I perceived to be animalistic and what I perceived to be complacent were in direct opposition to each other. If I did not know, how could I claim to live the greater of the two lives?</p>
<p>A part of me imagined the greater life was the one proclaimed by all great people as they passed into history. The other part of me desperately believed their revelation was found only in the wisdom of old age where there was no other choice, like regret only after having been caught, such that any attempt of them explaining themselves fell on my soft ears. What if all along I had mistaken stubbornness for tenacity, arrogance for courage, and weakness for humility? My only option was to hook my shaky finger under the wire of culpability and trace it to its truth, praying that it did not lead to restructuring everything I believed…</p>
<p>If only understanding my thoughts and emotions was as simple as tracing a wire! It was more like trying to trace the roots of a tree as it burrowed deep into the ground. No matter which root of reasoning I tried to follow, I would push the dead leaves aside and abruptly hit the earthy floor where only speculation could go further. My fists would clench, and no amount of stamping at the dirt did the root of truth shake out.</p>
<p>I fell to the ground. What if the greater life was the shorter life, ready to move on at any moment? How could I ever confront death? Kneeling defeated in the soil, pondering the feat I faced, it wasn't the truth I found. It was a realization—there was something aching to crawl out of its stenching hole that only upon spouting my desire to live forever did I notice its long nails clawing through the bare dirt by my knees. </p>
<p>Beneath the detritus—the mulch and leaf matter that clung to my knees—the roots of the forest intertwined like the branches overhead. Therein lied the shared tune of all my problems. Of all of the roots that I had been incapable of following to the end, like shadowing ants as they traveled through the small gravel valley which formed between pavement lines, only to lose them scattering into the yard under the decaying leaves of autumn that I had been too reluctant to rake up. Under the debris of time, all the aspects of quality and subjectiveness that plagued my ideology could be traced and transcribed into their natural, quantitative realities. What a power that would be! It was a power whose very existence was as inhibiting as it was intriguing, halting me in my tracks. A power which declared “Everything you know and everything you are can be derived from this dirt. From the color blue to your need for affirmation. From your perception of space to your notion of time. Rooted in this dirt.” </p>
<p>I stopped searching for where the roots tunneled. It was a question left for the biologists and their shovels. I no longer needed to know, for I finally found the truth which contradicted every attempt of mine at understanding the human condition. When mighty trees magnanimously offered a gaze up into their glorious crown, while the gauntly undergrowth fought for the specks of sunlight trickling into the shadows beneath, who could blame me for not realizing they were nurtured from the same soil? Everyone I criticized and everyone I disagreed with would blame me anyway for being so foolishly perched at the pinnacle of that which I looked down upon. If I went running to declare “Megan! Megan! All our thoughts and emotions stem from the same place!”, she would chastise me for being so dumb: “Obviously! Anyone who had ever lived knew that our thoughts and emotions come from our brains!” Had she the same realization as I had and shrugged it off regardless? A child could conclude that two parallel lines would never meet. Would they understand the consequences of the unprovability of the axiom that their declaration laid for Euclidean geometry? They’d understand no more than that of the consequences which Santa’s existence would pose to the workings of the world. But the consequences of one would be an afternoon of tears, and the other a profound scratch of the head as to why it mattered... Theoretical mathematics did not bring them toys, after all.</p>
<p>And he, the Christian. Could he look at his god and profess “Even if I have not been worthy, I have lived my best!”? The sacrifice of God’s son should’ve meant a promise that he could depend upon to guide him into a better life, even if he only cared about that heavenly reward. Yet what apparently mattered more to him than loving others, than loving George, was a new car he could gloat of to society. I couldn’t say I would’ve done better, but there was a different level of belief, of realization, between he and the monk who fell to their knees in awe at the very thought of the unconditional love they received.</p>
<p>I kneeled at the base of the cloud of steam, lost in an infinite recursion of thought. It was not the realization that lust and greed grew next to those higher faculties which separated us from animals, but that there also originated my thoughts, my actions, my self-awareness, my self-reflection, my self-actualization, my self-realization—myself. It was a shift from an enlightening ‘oh’ to a deep, breathless ‘oh’ upon translating the meaning of life into the question of being, and in that breathless gasp the hand erupted from the dirt and bound a ball and chain about my ankles, like a tiger pouncing at its prey after waiting for it to so precariously falter that any escape would be hopeless.</p>
<p>The room went dark. The motor of the steam vent fan died. The only light was that of the setting sun that trickled through the frosted glass window. Then the water grew cold, and the hand near my shackled feet retreated. My thoughts settled. I turned the shower off and dried and dressed myself in the dark.</p>
<p>Downstairs, the front door creaked open and slammed shut. I followed its call, expecting it to be Dad having arrived home, but he was neither arriving nor leaving. He was sitting on the porch with a beer in his hand and Flint by his side. The smell of chicken and asparagus wafted from the kitchen as I watched him stare at the road.</p>
<p>I made my way to the front door and stepped outside. “Hey Dad.”</p>
<p>“Oh, hey Mickey,” he said, looking up over his shoulder. “Dinner’s on the table.”</p>
<p>“Got it done before the outage?” I asked.</p>
<p>“With time to spare.”</p>
<p>He looked back to the road, sipping his beer. The street lights flickered on in unison as the sky grew dark, but behind me, the house stayed quiet. Then I noticed the neighbors too had their lights on, and in Dad’s silent acceptance of the fact, I understood our house did not have an outage by mistake.</p>
<p>“Dad, do you think I am spoiled?”</p>
<p>He tilted his head quizzically. “What makes you think that?”</p>
<p>I sat on the steps next to him. “Bobby told me today that it was your idea for me to go with him. Was it because you thought I needed to learn the real world?”</p>
<p>“Well, of course that was a part of it,” Dad said, “but I knew Bobby did his weekend charity thing and you wanted to help people, so I thought it only made sense. I never considered you’d say no, so I never thought to ask you first. I’m sorry about that.” Then after a moment, he added, “You can stop if you want.”</p>
<p>“I actually quite enjoy it,” I replied. “Bobby is really insightful, you know?”</p>
<p>Dad laughed. “Word has it that you’ve been driving him up a wall.”</p>
<p>“We have interesting conversations. He enjoys them, even if he acts like he doesn’t. But you don’t think I’m spoiled?”</p>
<p>“I think you have opportunities that most people don’t, and I think that might affect your perspective in ways we can all learn to overcome, but I wouldn’t describe you as spoiled like you might think, no.”</p>
<p>I propped my arms behind me and stretched my legs on the steps. A sigh of relief, even if he was biased. Dad smiled into the distance down the road. Flint walked in a circle twice and layed down.</p>
<p>“I’ve been meaning to ask you something,” Dad said, clearing his throat. “How would you feel about moving?”</p>
<p>“Why are you asking that?”</p>
<p>“I know we promised to not move until you graduated, but that was before… everything with Mom.”</p>
<p>I hesitated to answer, not knowing if saying no was the most spoiled thing I could do.</p>
<p>“Everyday,” he continued, “I wake up to a house missing a piece of itself. We could move away and start fresh. Move on with life.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like you need it.”</p>
<p>“It’s also about what you need. How have you been holding up?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really think about it, to be honest. I get these things happen. So many of my classmates’ parents are divorced it made it feel more unique than anything that my parents were together for so long.” I shrugged.</p>
<p>“Just because everyone else deals with it doesn’t mean you can’t.”</p>
<p>In my mind, I shook my head. He didn’t know I never respected her because she never respected me. It was a rant I didn’t feel like giving. It didn’t even seem to matter. Reconciling with a lost relationship was nothing compared to reconciling with death. When the question of being was at the forefront of my mind, all other troubles faded into the background.</p>
<p>I stayed on the steps of the porch with him until the sun had fully set before leaving to grab a plate of dinner and return to my room. I lugged the ball and chain up the stairs with the flashlight on my phone to guide me, then set the plate on my desk and fell into the pitch black where my bed laid. My mind was exhausted from trying to comprehend the incomprehensible that, to the best of my knowledge, would remain forever incomprehensible. There was the catch—to the best of my knowledge, to the best of anyone’s knowledge—that I would hold onto like a lit match in the dark, but it seemed as unlikely as for the shockwaves and vibrations sent from a shattering pane of glass to reflect and shove the glass back into place as it would be to discover a different truth. </p>
<p>The edge of the blanket I laid upon was being tugged from beneath the bed, as if an entity was trying to pull me to the ground to finally meet.</p>
