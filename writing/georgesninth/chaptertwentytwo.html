<p>I awoke to the truck bobbling over the ledge of a driveway. It slowed to a halt and the gearshift clicked in succession to park.</p>
<p>“Welcome home,” Dad said, turning off the truck.</p>
<p>I fell asleep early in the drive, having not slept the night before. I had no idea where we were and no idea how long we had been driving. It must’ve been a trip, as I dreamt of a life long enough to think the last six months but another dream. </p>
<p>I rubbed my eyes and looked out the window at the new house. It was dwarfed by our old home. One might describe the house as quaint, maybe even humble depending on their part of town. It was only one story, and the front yard was a patch of grass on the sidewalk. I was relieved.</p>
<p>Dad twisted his keys in the front door locks. Flint barked on the other side. When Dad opened the door, Flint froze in confusion, then came tackling me with a force I thought he lost with age. I hugged him and scratched his ears and after a minute, he went trotting inside as if he wanted to show me around. I followed him in, all the way to his bed, where he grabbed a toy and put it in my hand.</p>
<p>“There’s lunch on the table,” Dad said, standing in the open doorway with his keys still in hand. “Your room is down the hallway on the left, and, well, you’ll figure out the rest. I have to get to work, but I’ll see you tonight.”</p>
<p>Before he left, I hugged him and thanked him for all that he’s done. When the door closed, I followed Flint to the backyard with the toy in hand.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>My room only had space for my bed and my dresser and my desk. My knick-knacks were set in their same spots, my clothes folded neatly in my drawers, and my guitar was set next to the window. Dad must have took pictures to remember where to put everything because I didn’t even remember where everything went.</p>
<p>All I remembered was the guitar next to the window so my audience could hear my music. The new window, however, looked into the street and into the hills only if I looked up to them. But I didn’t. There was no desire.</p>
<p>I remembered what Mother taught me before I left: of an existence of awe. What could I do but stare at it like painting on the wall? What was there to do? I was back to old Mickey me. Ready to return to the real world where there was work to be done and bills to be paid.</p>
<p>As it turned out, decent jobs were hard to come by as a teenage high school dropout with minimal experience and a criminal history. There were postings for manual labor like yard work or construction, and I almost called my name in if it wasn’t for the subtle hints of narcissism. I was Mickey Lee, a man of stories. Why be bossed around for cheap labor when I had an opportunity?</p>
<p>I told Dad my plans and asked for his truck. He let me have it as long as he could sell the car my mom got me to help buy himself a new one. With his truck and the savings I had, I bought a lawn mower, a weed eater, a leaf blower, and various other supplies, and a trailer to carry it all around. Then I drove into the hills, going door to door for new customers, as they were the ones who could afford weekly mowing services. </p>
<p>My competition knew that too, but I knew those streets better than the people who lived on them, and, in a select few cases, their own homes in a way. I knew which yards the families mowed themselves and which ones were already taken. Which ones reluctantly missed some weeks or had new move-ins. I knew where to hang my signs and how to spread my word. Growth was slow, but living with my dad allowed me to manage that.</p>
<p>As my list of customers grew, I searched for the place by the bridge Bobby told me about to hire extra help and regularly began stopping there in the morning. On days I could snatch Steven, I would. He had a lot to teach me about the nuances of the work as I was obviously new. Meanwhile, I strove to turn Mickey’s Mowing into a legal business. I absolutely hated the name, but it was stuck on all of my advertisements. </p>
<p>What I loved most about the job is how stress-free it was, and how I could leave it behind at the end of each workday, unlike school that lingered around in the nights with extra work and no compensation. But in the eventless nights, I struggled in a search for a will to live—to truly live life. What more was there for someone to do once they found an answer to their existential question? I had no more to search for that demanded my immediate attention. My dilemma was solved. The story was over.</p>
<p>There I found the devil haunting me in my days and dreams, in my musings as I mowed the lawns and stared at the stars in eventless nights. I didn’t think she meant that I should never think my hunger had been satisfied, but merely to not fool myself into believing it, because for a time, I did think that. Why was it so easy to forget and so hard to remember? Perhaps because I wasn’t in a search for a will to live, for the search itself is a will to live, but I was lost for a will to search for a will to live.</p>
<p>She woke me up in the middle of the night and slapped me in the face and forced me to take to the streets and run. I did not go through everything just to fall again. The story was never over. It was but a new epoch.</p>
<p>I forgot how much I hated running, and how much pleasure I found in doing it anyway. There was no logic to it. Rather, it was, as I would say, undeniably true. I could not deny it for it was implanted into me deeper than my own mind. That realization along my journey was the true key to everything. They created wills that drove no matter how much I could wish it away, so if I ever needed a will to do anything, I could let myself become animalistic and tie that drive into what I needed.</p>
<p>Yes, I lived out of spite. Yes, I lived in self-conceit. Yes, I lived for that feeling of power. Yes, I lived to make the best girl in the world fall in love with me. It was against my ego, but necessary of me to embrace those vulnerabilities if I wanted to achieve anything at all. I hid them beneath my mask, away from anyone’s knowledge, afraid of being misunderstood. I was still a boy in that regard.</p>
<p>Yet, as much of a boy as I still was, it was easy to forget how far I had come. I wasn’t keeping track. Truly, I could then say in all seriousness that it was not about the destination but the journey.</p>
<p>Were these not the most trite conclusions to come to, after everything? From an outsider’s perspective, it was. From my perspective, however, there was a new understanding. </p>
<p>What the word virtue meant to Aristotle was different than what it meant to the layman, as Aristotle spent his life pondering over that lone word. It was a word that, while it held the same definition, took on new meaning subconsciously—a realm unable to be traveled to—so that when he said the word and others heard the word and both agreed on the definition, they were not in the same understanding. It would be a moot dialogue in the limitations of language. Such was the need for stories.</p>
<p>I began to wonder, then, if the meaning to life was much the same. It’s just a shame that my understanding of the word was so volatile.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Mowing was a lot like running. It gave plentiful time to explore the antipodal sides of ones mind that do not surface in the limbo of a classroom or comfort of a cell. I still lived my stories when I ran, but without George or Lucas at my side, I learned to use music as Lucas had done. Most of it was drowned out by the sweat. But the lines that slipped through, now heard from the ears of an animal chasing its prey of a dream, meant a world different than the ears of one reclined in bed or drowning out the noise of rush hour traffic.</p>
<p>“With dreams to be a king; first, one should be a man.”</p>
<p>Nothing truer could have been said to anyone, in no truer of a place than atop the dam.</p>
<p>I heard the song many times before. Only then did that line mean anything to me. Only then did I understand where the path I treaded now was meant to be taking me, and only because I understood it did I quicken my pace and take the rough turns at its forks so that I wouldn’t regret having taken the other path after treading so far down it, in a worthless, tiresome circle of a direction opposite to my desire, that there was no turning back.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The last night pertinent to the story to begin all stories was a night I invited Hugo over to my house to play the N64 my dad got me.</p>
<p>We smashed away on our controllers, shooting the pixelated bloodthirsty demons, with a mostly-eaten box of pizza open on my desk alongside a mostly-drank liter of orange juice. Such nights were the nights that made my life worth living, a regular of ours on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>“So now that you have your answers,” Hugo said, “what then?”</p>
<p>I was still immersed in the game, landing a sweet move that I was upset Hugo might’ve missed when he glanced at me. “Then its time for my next story,” I said.</p>
<p>“And what is that?” he asked, not letting up.</p>
<p>I sighed. “I’m not sure.”</p>
<p>A cutscene interrupted our conversation. We listened intently to the dialogue, wondering where the story was headed. The screen faded back to play and the pace of the level instantly peaked. Hugo and I leaned forward, twisting our controllers and swaying our bodies. Had we physically been inside the game, I doubt we’d ever be able to return to the real world.</p>
<p>At least, I wouldn’t. Not without the alarm that’d pry me from such a world in my dreams.</p>
<p>When we reached the rescue ship, our characters flew away as the score was posted in the foreground.</p>
<p>“I’m taking a trip,” Hugo said. “I’m going to spend some time overseas. I want you to come along.”</p>
<p>I pressed the “Start Next Level” button and Hugo immediately paused the opening cutscene.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I have a business to run and I can’t leave all that behind on a whim.”</p>
<p>“I thought you were hiring Steven?”</p>
<p>“That’s the plan.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s not like you’d lose all your customers.”</p>
<p>“I still need to grow the business. And Steven can’t do everything on his own. And it’s a lot of money to travel that I’m not comfortable losing...”</p>
<p>As soon as those words left my mouth, I realized the person I was opting to be. Such excuses would always be present in my life, and as I got older, it’d only become more difficult. So then, could I say I’d never want to travel with my friend? If I told Hugo no, then I’d forever be telling Hugo no. It made me uncomfortable. It made me anxious. Part of me wished he had asked at another time.</p>
<p>Mother backhanded me with a force of a thousand falling stones. What would George do?</p>
<p>George would ask Hugo first. George wouldn’t wait until he was comfortable, nor wait until the opportunity was presented. He would make the opportunity happen himself and grasp it before it was ready to be grasped.</p>
<p>“When and where?” I asked.</p>
<p>I made a promise to myself. A promise was unconditional.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I visited George’s grave over a year after that day in the café. I wanted to say I was finally better than him, having had an extra year to catch up, which is a long time if you stare at it without taking your eyes off. But he would always be greater than me, for he had the most significant story possible, to cross into the realm beyond life. I was not ready to do that yet. I still had so many adventures to go on in the realm of the living to take the all-or-nothing chance exploring beyond it. I still saw this life as all-or-nothing, every passing second a second spent on everything or on nothing at all.</p>
<p>“I finally found my answer,” I said to him. “Is that how you found yours? Being driven to utter desperation?”</p>
<p>Of course, there was no answer. But I asked rhetorically, for myself, just to see if reconnecting with him in the best way I could would help me imagine how he’d answer. The only thing I realized was I really missed the guy. My life had changed so much that I’d be completely different than he’d remember me and I’d wonder why he hadn’t changed as well, and that incongruence would tear us apart. But I’d always be horrendously jealous of him.</p>
<p>Looking at his grave, it was almost a surprise the world didn’t cease its existence with his passing, for the world was his. But, I think he passed it onto me, in a way. It was my world now.</p>
