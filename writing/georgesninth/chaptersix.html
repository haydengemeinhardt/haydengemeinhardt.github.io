								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Six</h1><br>
<p>The clouds darkened the shy Autumn sun by the time George, Lucas, and I took to the streets. We ran near Lucas’s neighborhood where bright streetlights lit the roads at dusk, twinkling in the occasional puddles of rainwater. Branches loomed overhead and saturated the sky a deep orange. Winds tore at the leaves which crunched on the sidewalk under our feet, speckled brooks that trailed beneath bridges, and coated yards up to the wet mulched gardens spotted by the last blooms from late flowers.</p>
<p>The cluttering of a diesel engine approached to our right, where a large puddle straddled the curb. I jumped to the side to avoid being drenched. Even I knew that there was no story in being drenched in muddy water. The true story is to be swept away by someone else and grow to become great friends and old lovers. If I believed such a dream was possible, I’d go searching for the waves, to go chasing after 18-wheelers near puddles like ice cream trucks.</p>
<p>But George, who had been running in front of me, did not escape the wave. There must’ve been some angel to save him, or that he, the man of stories, was testing and granting me the chance to swoop in—but he tossed his arms in the air and dashed through it like a waterfall.</p>
<p>I was a spiteful old man whose sweaty, beating heart churned at the sight of a kid having fun being incapable of it myself. I was living in George’s dream where even if I had independently decided to play the same, I would’ve merely been his shadow—no, within his shadow, as he had shadowed every day I ever lived. Bad day after bad day doomed by his existence. And the thing about bad days—bad lives—is they tend to become worse—that the only bad thing that could happen was for no other bad thing to happen, a day of monotony; Paradoxically, supposedly, the limbo that plagued my life of monotony.</p>
<p>And as if God had heard my challenge once more, there it came.</p>
<p>“Mickey, you okay?” George called. Lucas stopped with him.</p>
<p>I had rubbernecked past a driveway that of a stranger where a gray Ferrari parked with a certain license plate appended to its end that of my mother. She was never in that part of town any more than I was. What a coincidence! Would it be so kind of me to let her know that Dad was wondering where she was?</p>
<p>While Lucas and George waited for me at the base of the driveway, I rang the doorbell. When the door never opened, I rang again.</p>
<p>Some persistence later, the door swung open. In its frame stood a man with messy black hair not styled but was-styled-and-is-no-longer. He wore an untucked button down and loose dress pants without a tie or shoes to match. He stood still, bemused at the sweaty teenager banging on his door.</p>
<p>“Is my mom here?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Lee, is she here?”</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>I pointed to the gray car in the driveway. “That’s hers.”</p>
<p>“Go home kid,” he said, moving to shut the door.</p>
<p>“Mickey?” Mom’s voice echoed down the entryway.</p>
<p>I leaned to look past his shoulder and caught sight of her. “That’s me.”</p>
<p>The man stepped aside, and Mom took his place. Her shirt and hair appeared to be tucked and fixed via cursory thrusts and finger combs, and her heels and watch were missing. The two were a pair who looked to have stripped all extraneous accessories the moment they stepped in the door.</p>
<p>“Hey sweetie,” she said as casually as if she had regularly called me sweetie since I was taller than her, “what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Running. You?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you boys run around here?”</p>
<p>“Only today.”</p>
<p>“Well, we have to get back to work. It’s been a crazy day at the office, lots of work to do!” She chuckled, in the superficial way that she did not do at home.</p>
<p>We continued our run, and I thought it was not worth the breath to break the continuity of the stories that played in Lucas and I’s minds. What was there to share? That I expected the resolution of a fight when I got home? </p>
<p>What I was not expecting was to return home to Dad’s truck alone in the driveway and it having been alone the entire run. He was utterly unaware, and told me to just grab a plate of dinner since Mom was working late.</p>
<p>“She called?” I asked between pants, struggling to untie my shoes without falling over. “Did she say where she was?”</p>
<p>“Well no,” he said, “why would she?”</p>
<p>The question was poised, and suddenly the fate of a tale was left in my hands. Why had she left it to me to decide? Because my mother knew me. I was her failure of a son who let the world spin for itself and took the consequences on the chin. How could she have predicted me tattling? People never change. And truth be told, I didn’t change. I just forgot I could shrug. I was too exhausted to think, and once the answer was spilled, it was too late.</p>
<p>So I told Dad what had happened. I gave him the address and he drove off in a fury as I slopped mashed potatoes onto my plate. I added chicken and asparagus on the side, brought it to my room, and started a shower. The initial burst of cold water jolted my heart as it rinsed me of my sweat. When it finished washing my sweat down the drain, it clouded the bathroom in a warm steam–the peeled-grape treatment of a shower full of daydreaming and sipping the hot water that flowed down my cheek as I slumped my head in exhaustion. But when I turned off the shower, a veil of ignorance was lifted. Words like “liar”, “cheater”, and “divorce” were thrown like bricks about the house. As I dried and dressed, my mother switched between a cover story, an apology, and blaming my father.</p>
<p>My plate clinked as I forked the last bits of asparagus into my mouth, formulating how the fight might dovetail into my application. A struggle I had to overcome? An excuse for my poor grade? Yet, the more I sat blanking at the pages, one door removed from the muffled chaos, the more I despised being forced to play judge in whether to tell Dad because I was ringing doorbells in search for answers I didn’t want. I wanted to believe I was finally living like George whilst two people dearest to my heart thrust and threw and whirled words and dishes and vases and suitcases and doors until it crescendoed into a deafening silence.</p>
<p>What if it was a one-off mistake she realized moments before I knocked on the door? What if nothing was going on at all? What if I kept quiet and they both lived happily married while she indulged in her surreptitious affair? What if I saved Dad a half-life of dejection? Only forgiveness could tell, and I did not have the position to give it, only to receive the consequences. </p>
<p>I collected my dishes and returned downstairs where my dad sat on the couch staring at a family photo too soon to replace, struggling to pull anger where sadness surfaced. Buttered mashed-potatoes and red wine trailed to the entryway, where splashes of shards littered the mat reading: “Welcome to the Lee household, forever split and stained by Mickey!”. </p>
<p>How does one believe in justice, to partake in the dealing of due punishment as though it were some festivity? How does one believe what they've done was right when they can only see the consequences?</p>
<p>I returned to my room with the plate in hand and left it on my dresser. Then I laid down on the floor and stared at the ceiling.</p>
<p>It was the consequences that told people they did the right thing, for otherwise there was no thing done. Accordingly, people loved consequences: a love for karma, to infatuate themselves with a fantasy that law and order are natural and some force of the universe existed to enforce it; a love for punishment, that evil doers should rot in prison. But it was never about justice. Evil was subjective, and subjectivity was inconsistent. Inconsistency was ignored, ignorance praised, and punishment masqueraded as justice.</p>
<p>If I were to proclaim this to any of them, I too would become their enemy, for what they truly loved more than justice is projecting evil onto their neighbors, such that they could practice convenient good. To fight evil was to feel good, and to feel good was to be celebrated! And so they would happily, complacently, conveniently live in perpetual cognitive dissonance without any need to rationalize their actions in the meaningless, nihilistic society.</p>
<p>I could imagine the chants and cheers of a crowd of young men in the streets when war against the evil Nazis was declared. And make no mistake—Lucas, George, and I would be cheering too! Me the loudest!  It wasn’t about justice for me either; for me a great story would be well underway. For the same reason the gum wrapper laid next to my keys and billfold and why I barged into homes in my dreams: it was about the thrill, not justice, and thrills transcended all else except the boundaries I held in respect for others.</p>
<p>But downstairs, there was no story. No victor. No punished evil. Only failure. And I was the hander of that justice, like a deistic god, a shy judge who deserved to be judged in return, hiding on the floor out of view from the city that could’ve collectively peered in my window at any second. But they wouldn’t—no one knew my name, and would refuse to even if they did, for they were too busy with their own lives. I was a nobody lying comatose on the floor of his room while everyone else was out in the world living their lives, experiencing stories, deriving excuses to stay up late when I had none.</p>
<p>My back was glued to the hardwood floor, my eyes tethered to the flat ceiling. I did not know when I fell asleep or between what thoughts I did, but not much longer did the morning alarm ring. There were no dreams nor sweat on my forehead. It was as though I blinked and the moon skipped across the sky. I only knew time had passed because the glue hardened overnight.</p>
<p>I flailed my arm toward my phone and silenced the alarm. A night without a dream did not bring a new day, a fresh start neatly separating the past from the present so that the happenings of yesterday can be shaved and washed away. The present continues stretching unnaturally beyond its elastic limit, like when the runners high transforms a 5k to a 25k and the quick work out becomes an adventure that the body was not prepared to handle. And like a long run, my body loathed all but to lie cemented to the floor while a gun pinched tightly into my temple by a need for a future that was more bearing than hunger.</p>
<p>The house was silent. Although the sun had yet to rise, my heart jumped to double check the time, worried that I woke to my weekend alarm, for Mom blaring the news and Dad sizzling eggs were as tied to the time of day as the hands on a clock. Of course, all clocks break with time. I peeled my back off the floor before the glue could harden any further. I skipped the morning shower and change of clothes—it was still the same day, was it not?—and stepped down the stairs into the aftermath.</p>
<p>The only cleaning done was done by Flint, who was licking his chops in delight amidst untouched asparagus and buttered mashed potatoes and red wine. In the kitchen, segments of a plate with smears of grease cluttered the counter. Why did they throw the chicken too? Flint must’ve had a feast, as I was out two days of lunch.</p>
<p>Bad day, bad day.</p>
<p>I might’ve gone without lunch too, had I not had to run later, so I pushed the broken plate aside and pulled the bread and peanut butter and honey and slathered sandwiches together and, with the naïve idea to reinvigorate the day, made a second lunch. I wanted to live like George.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he was out to put me in my place. He proved there was no chance. I was not him.</p>
<p>In first period math class, Mr.  Frederick encouraged class participation, as if he didn’t know no one wanted to blurt wrong answers at eight in the morning, or if it was a formality or way of speaking, or if he was forced to by the education board. George didn’t question it. He would volunteer without hesitation and scribble equations on the board to answers he didn’t know the answer to. He wasn’t like me in that he thought he might know the answer were a hint given. He knew he didn’t know and in that he sought to find out.</p>
<p>While George was making a fool of himself on the board, I was daydreaming about lunch. It was a dreadful commitment I made. My heart thudded at the thought. After Mr. Frederick helped George through the solution, George returned to his seat next to me and whispered, “it’s fascinating, I didn’t think it was possible!”</p>
<p>“It’s called Gabriel’s horn,” Mr. Frederick said, “infinite surface area but finite volume. The proof will be on your final, so make sure to study it.”</p>
<p>My heart thudded too deeply to care. It had total control over me.</p>
<p>In English, Mrs. Spring invited us to read sections of our papers to the class. George raised his hand and stood without her needing to call on him. After all, no one else had the courage to put their best versions of themselves on display.</p>
<p>“Many misinterpret Dickens’ criticization,” George said. “It was never about the wealthy versus the poor, nor the majority versus the individual, but the over-rationalization of an industrial society. This is represented from the first pages, when the children are in class and Mr. Gradgrind says to them, ‘Facts alone are wanted in life […] Plant nothing else, and root out everything else’’. Mr. Gradgrind is demanding children rip out their adventurous hearts—a satirical representation of the dominant utilitarianists of Victorian England that Dickens’ disagreed with. While enveloping his argument in a story may obscure his intention, to express his argument in a logical format would contradict his point. Thus, one must be equally careful to not misinterpret his point as they are to not miss it.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Mrs. Spring interrupted. “Does anyone have idea on how we can improve this part?”</p>
<p>I lifted my hand with my elbow still on the table, partly out of sight behind the person in front of me. I wanted to say he should have expanded more on his discussion, but Mrs. Spring did not see me, or she saw me and didn’t care to call on me, or she wasn’t expecting anyone to raise their hand and didn’t look for anyone to do so.</p>
<p>Mrs. Spring provided her own feedback, then made the class clap and let George sit down. She continued rambling. I stared into the desk, daydreaming about how I was going to explain my bad grade in an admission interview.</p>
<p>“You okay?” George whispered. The second time in a day he had asked me that.</p>
<p>“How are you always so excited about everything?” I asked. “With everything going on in your life—no offense—I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>He tilted his head in confusion. “Is it about last night?”</p>
<p>“What? No.”</p>
<p>“Will you tell me what’s going on?”</p>
<p>Me? Burden him? With my problems? It was only because I knew him that I didn’t strangle him. “Later,” I said. “Seriously, though.”</p>
<p>George sighed and pursed his lips in thought, swinging his pencil in oscillation pinched between two fingers. “Well,” he said, “I guess always have something to look forward to. Coffee in the morning, lunch with you guys, our run after school, Joey at home. And if one thing goes wrong, I have nine more.” He paused, then smiled. “And soon, I’ll see mom back home, I’ll finally submit college applications, and even compete at state one final time.” He clenched his hand. “Hopefully to win it this time.”</p>
<p>It sounded so simple, but I was not George. The things I looked forward to were far beyond the horizon. I could chase after the sun for hours and never get close, its position changing due to no cause of my own. Maybe it was about time I gave up on those aspirations. I wasn’t cut out for them.</p>
<p>“I suppose I have to beat you first, though,” George said, winking. “It’s on today.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Spring said nothing about our whispering. George was her best student.</p>
<p>Western Civilization was the last period before lunch. The class passed by in a blur. Mr. Champi continued talking of the Romans from last class, and I dozed off. He mentioned the stoics, and I dozed off again. He circled back to the Christians, and as I was dozing off, he snapped my name and warned me not to do it again.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be lunch already.</p>
<p>Mr. Champi pointed at a timeline of Rome on the projector. “Now, if the Roman government did not officially start persecuting Christians until Emperor Nero, why do you think the Romans painfully crucified Jesus instead of using the normal means of execution?”</p>
<p>I raised my hand. Mr. Champi hid rolling his eyes at me, as though he thought I were about to ask to go to the bathroom. But I kept my hand raised high so he would be forced to call on me, and so he did.</p>
<p>“Because they wanted to make an example,” I said.</p>
<p>"Not quite," he replied, nodding. "Anyone else?”</p>
<p>Hugo, the person that sat next to me, raised his hand. “He was a threat to the church, not the government, so the church chose the means of execution.”</p>
<p>“Closer, but still no. Anyone else?” No one raised their hand. If only George was there. “He was crucified in part because, yes, his claim was considered treasonous, but also in part because he was not a Roman citizen. One could argue it was by pure happenstance—or predestination, depending on what you believe—of his lack of citizenship that the pain Jesus suffered in the story of the crucifixion became a symbol to western society. It is something you will see in history time and time again, that the impact of the most important events in history aren’t realized until years, decades, or centuries later. Columbus’s voyage, Treaty of Versailles, Rosetta Stone—all made by individuals who were not aware of the compounding impact of their actions in the future.”</p>
<p>Ironic. Even the son of God had an exaggerated story on his resume. But at least it was still a story, and that I did not have.</p>
<p>While I did not answer a single question correctly, it kept me awake, and kept everyone else wondering what game I was playing. The idea of doing something different than the personality assigned to you from the first week was alien to them all. Change is challenging, and always has been challenging as Mr. Champi taught. Change interrupts their status quo of complacency, for once one falls into their slot, they must never move from it, or they risk changing the projected course of their world.</p>
<p>The bell rang and the room filled with screeching chairs and chatter. “Everyone have a safe afternoon,” Mr. Champi yelled. “See you all tomorrow.”</p>
<p>I pushed my way through the door and down the long, bustling hallways of bodies out to the courtyard for lunch. I was excited to breathe unbreathed air. The moment I stepped outside, a desire above my comprehension took control of my heart in face of what I was set out to do.</p>
<p>Jenny and I shared overlapping lunch periods. She was in the middle of the courtyard, customarily squished in the middle of a table for twelve where sixteen juniors sat. No lunch in front of her. Her side was turned to me and she was engulfed in conversation, unaware of my approaching behind her. When I leaned over her shoulder and set the second brown lunch bag on the table, she spun in shock, whiffing the looseness of the shirt with the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>“Courtesy of the Lee household,” I said.</p>
<p>The two girls she was talking to giggled. Jenny’s face shot a bright pink. “What’s this for?”</p>
<p>“For lunch, you goofball.”</p>
<p>One of the girls, covering her laughter with her hand, asked, “Is the other bag for me?”</p>
<p>“I put extra in hers if she wants to share.”</p>
<p>I don’t know why I said that. It drew the attention of others at the table who caught what was happening and laughter spread like fire. Trying to act like George would naturally bring attention. I wished it could have been the kind of attention George normally received, but the things he did were natural and mine gawky. He didn’t try to be himself. He just was.</p>
<p>I shook my head and left. I’d see her at work later anyway.</p>
<p>Jenny stomped after me. “Why are you acting like an idiot?”</p>
<p>Her face was twisted in a fury, only making me want to poke her again, so she would go back and eat her stupid lunch and stop making more of a scene. “A cute idiot, I don’t reject it.”</p>
<p>“Your audacity is astounding.” She shook her head and turned away.</p>
<p>“Just trying to do something nice,” I mumbled.</p>
<p>Jenny grabbed my shoulder with a fistful of cloth and forced me to face her. She pulled at my shirt and clenched her teeth ready to retaliate. Her seething stare into my eyes was penetrating and consuming. Then she paused. Her furrowed brows relaxed and raised, her grip loosened on my shirt, her bottom lip fell open just a tiny bit, and she asked with all the sincerity in the world, “Are you okay, Manual?”</p>
<p>She struck me out of my haze for a split-second. All the bad feelings flowed back into me while I was staring into her hazel eyes as they stared back into mine. My heart, in its vulnerable, thudding state, synchronized to her. I wanted to tell her “I’ve been having a bad day” and melt in her grip. I wanted to tell her “things seem to be falling apart” and hug her and cry. For that brief period, I imagined there was a world where I could validate my pain.</p>
<p>A voice amongst the laughter ejected from the table, as though the words could be suppressed no longer, “Did you bring lunch for her boyfriend too?”</p>
<p>The words flattened my heart and folded my lungs. My pain returned insufferable. </p>
<p>Jenny didn’t flinch. In her mind, we were only somewhere between coworkers and part time or temporary friends. The teasing did not flatten her heart and fold her lungs as it did mine.</p>
<p>“I’m just tired,” I said, “but I'm fine. I promise.”</p>
<p>It was a promise whose only point was to make me a liar. It was to remind myself who she was–George’s younger sister.</p>
<p>She gave me a brief, friendly hug before returning to her table. I continued toward mine in hopes George and Lucas were blind.</p>
<p>But the day just kept getting worse.</p>
<p>Lucas sat with folded arms, holding back a smirk. “I’m going to pretend I didn’t see that.”</p>
<p>“Nothing gets past you,” I said, collapsing into my seat. I tossed my brown bag onto the table..</p>
<p>“Lighten up,” George said with half a sandwich stuffed in his cheek, setting down his sandwich and rubbing his napkin. “You beat me the other day. I told you I’d be fine with it.”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “That was a joke.”</p>
<p>“Even if it was, I trust you more than anyone else to make her happy.”</p>
<p>“Because I ran faster than you once?”</p>
<p>George swallowed his food. “Because you’re a good guy, Mickey. I don’t care what others say.” Then took another bite.</p>
<p>The others, whoever he might’ve been referring to and whatever they might've said, were probably right. I twiddled my finger in the rubber grille of the table. “We’re just friends.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see,” Lucas teased, “is that what’s been going on?”</p>
<p>“Nothing's been going on.”</p>
<p>Lucas shrugged and we kept eating. The bell for next period rang sometime later, and I was off to Chemistry with Lucas.</p>
<p>The room for Chemistry had only two windows. When Mrs. Truman turned off the lights for the powerpoint, the room went dark. I crossed my arms on the desk and rested my chin.</p>
<p>Time skipped forward. Lucas nudged me awake. “Straight talk, Mickey,” he whispered. “Do you actually like George’s sister?”</p>
<p>I yawned silently and wiped the water from my eyes.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to be rude,” Lucas continued, “but I don’t understand. Theres not a lot to her to make a fool of yourself like that.”</p>
<p>“Valence electrons fill the outer layer,” Mrs. Truman said, “and the inner electrons act as a sort of shield between the forces of valence electrons and the nucleus. Now remember, the ionization energy is the charge between the electrons and the nucleus divided by the radius and multiplied by some constant. So can anyone then explain why the noble gasses have the highest ionization energy compared to other elements with similar atomic numbers?”</p>
<p>“Why not someone like Samantha?” Lucas nodded across the room at a girl slouched on a propped hand sneakily scrolling on her phone. “I mean, holy shit Mickey, there’s not a lot of guys that’d say no to her, and she’s over there browsing your Instagram like a damn magazine.”</p>
<p>She was cute, funny, and smart. I’ve browsed her Instagram, too, for photos of adventures or awkward takes, but I only found puckered lips in the mirror of an expensive car with an emoji for a caption. If anyone knew me at all, they’d know why I didn’t pursue Samantha.</p>
<p>When the bell rang, Lucas nudged me toward her, as though he was trying to live vicariously through me. No one could ask for any better of a time to approach someone than dismissal. But I left. I had places to be. The period of messing around after school with Lucas and George was over. It was a period so insignificant that it was marked by sitting at the world's worst café, now but a memory as life transitioned into a new stage in the race where my heavy, tired foot rested against the brake, sitting idly in a line of cars on my way to work after school, realizing that Lucas was right: I had wontedly chose to chastise myself in the name of being a good little principled boy on time for work.</p>
<p>I parked next to Jenny five minutes late. She was working alongside Daniel in the first stall of the express lane, positioning an oil drain tank underneath a car racked six feet up. An overhead door blocked entry to the second stall.</p>
<p>Jenny followed Daniel around the underside of the car marking on the clipboard as he performed routine inspection. Daniel pointed behind the wheel and said something to Jenny. Then he handed her the clipboard and went to the main building.</p>
<p>Oil slowed to a trickle when I reached Jenny attempting to check the tire pressure, reaching for the valve on her tippy toes. When I lowered the car a couple of inches for her, she jumped like a startled rabbit.</p>
<p>“Careful!” she yelled. “The tank is under there.”</p>
<p>I raised the car back up a couple of inches higher than it was, so that even on her tippy toes she couldn’t see what she was doing. She folded her arms. Bobby side-eyed me with disapproval from the neighboring stall. I raised my hands apologetically and carefully lowered the car to an appropriate height.</p>
<p>“How’d you get here so fast?” I asked. “Did you skip class?”</p>
<p>She twisted off the valve cap. Air hissed into the pressure gauge. She checked the number and marked it on the clipboard. “No,” she said, “I just went around the accident. Didn’t you get the traffic notification?”</p>
<p>“I turned those off,” I said. “Where’s Greg?</p>
<p>“Out sick.”</p>
<p>I sighed. There was hardly need for one of us to help do L.O.F.s, let alone two. I asked around seeing if anyone needed help. Everyone was fine. I returned to Jenny and asked if she wanted help because no one else needed it, and her face twisted with insult. So, I sat on the concrete in the doorway of the garage with my back to the wall, soaking in the sunlight, watching her work with efficiency as if she was trying to pump out cars like lattes.</p>
<p>“I never got to ask,” I said, “why did you quit the café for this?”</p>
<p>“Better pay,” she replied, unscrewing the old oil filter.</p>
<p>“Do you like this more?”</p>
<p>She set the old filter on the counter and unpackaged a new one, rubbing a smidge of the old oil along its rim before screwing it in. “It’s okay.”</p>
<p>She continued working in the strange state where she pretended like she was terrible at multitasking and couldn’t talk. I didn’t care what awkwardness lingered from earlier—I wanted to sit her down and interrogate her and extract the Lebedev secrets. To spend hours getting to know her over a cup of coffee, like listening to an uncle’s lore firsthand with all their expressions and enthusiasm. But tools were broad shields in Jenny’s hands, the sun a warm blanket, the clamor of the shop a familiar noise, and my eyelids unbearably heavy. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I found myself planted in an uncomfortably hard seat in an older classroom at Valencia. The floor was white linoleum. The walls were beige in contrast to the 80’s wood vinyl of the desktops propped on wobbly steel legs. A clock ticked toward ten-twenty above the doorway. The professor took attendance and dismissed class. A smile crept across my face–basking in my success, and sheer luck. <i>I made it in.</i> I shoved my notebook into my backpack and my pencil into my pocket and squeezed into the hall alongside a crowd of strangers. But once I entered the hall, I did not know where to go. My schedule was difficult to remember. I only had four classes, right? No! I had five! How many weeks into the semester had I forgotten about it? And like the sudden feeling of an empty pocket where a phone or billfold should’ve been, I clawed out my class schedule. Biology. Hofmann Hall. Room 120.</p>
<p>Building by building passed alongside the minutes on a clock, then door by door with the seconds in an emptying hall, until I was alone racing in an infinite circle of numbers. I halted at the passing of an open door with 120 plastered beneath its eye height window. Everyone was too deeply buried in a test to catch me at the door. Some stared blankly at their desk or to the ceiling, others raced with their pencil while their neighbors side-eyed the answers. I grabbed a test from the front and jumped into the nearest desk, but before I could retrieve the pencil from my pocket, my eyes glanced over the first page and twisted my brain into painful knots. There was no chance I could remotely guess an answer. I had not attended a single class. What was once a smile was then a frown. It was a familiar feeling–the same I felt looking at my application. The dream turned lucid. I never got into Valencia, nor would I ever. My head cramped tighter, processing the situation. The details fell from my senses. The scene faded. My mind returned to the black limbo of sleep.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I shot awake. A hand ruffled my hair. The light stung my eyes.</p>
<p>“Morning Manual.”</p>
<p>“Caught in the act.” I rested my head back against the wall, squinting my eyes. It was maddening that my mind could deceive itself into living another life as though I could be pulled from my own too at any moment.</p>
<p>“Caught is an understatement,” she said, motioning to the busy highway at the end of the parking lot. “Half the city saw you sleeping.”</p>
<p>I doubted anyone in those cars saw me sleeping. They were likely looking down at the road, the steering wheel, their phones. The entire shop though–I didn't doubt for a second “Sleeper” would be my callsign. “My dad is going to be pissed.” </p>
<p>Jenny knelt down and plucked a white string off my black shirt. “If he was pissed, he would have woken you up, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Maybe,” I said. Though it was certain he was disappointed at the last piece of his failure of a family.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” Jenny said. “I took care of everything on my own. But it’s closing time, which means it’s time for you to get up.”</p>
<p>Jenny outstretched her hand. No sight was ever more humbling. Why were these people—those who would laugh in the face of my troubles compared to the sheer mountain of theirs—willing to help me? Me who had hardly tasted the cruel side of the world, barked like a dog for that taste, and wallowed as one whose mental anguish was greater than that of a starving and tortured child because for the first time in my life I experienced denial and so much had been going well for me that I never dealt with it. I thought myself a disciplined man who could run to the world’s end no matter the agony, spend sleepless nights studying without pause, and remain patient under the most trying of times. Clearly, that was not the case.</p>
<p>“Well, come on,” she said.</p>
<p>I grasped her hand and hoisted myself to my feet. “Are you in a rush?”</p>
<p>“George and I have errands to run before it gets too late.”</p>
<p>“Errands?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, errands.”</p>
<p>“Since when do you two have errands to run?”</p>
<p>“Since Dad flew out with Mom,” she said. “They’re going ahead with treatment out-of-state. Didn’t George tell you?”</p>
<p>I checked my phone: George had texted the group over an hour before that he had things to do so we’d run later. I groaned; I wanted to go to bed, damn it. But he hadn’t told me. I buried my phone and shook my head. He probably didn’t want to deal with Lucas and I rushing to his side. He was sick and tired of people taking his own news worse than him. </p>
<p>“If you need help,” I said, “let me know.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “Just make sure George doesn’t do anything stupid while they’re away.”</p>
<p>Bobby flipped a series of switches in the control panel on the other side of the garage. The overhead doors creaked and crept toward the Earth. Jenny fetched her bag off the ground and walked into the sunlight before they closed. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Mickey.”</p>
<p>“You too, Jenny.”</p>
<p>We split like long-time co-workers. Complacent and casual. Two things I hated; two things I involuntarily yielded. She walked to her car as the iron curtains cut my sight from her. I wondered if I’d see her again before the attempted treatment, and if she’d still be the same Jenny I knew.</p>
<p>I helped Dad close the shop and drove home behind him. When we arrived, I pushed past Flint, stepped over the dried wine, climbed the stairs, set an alarm for the run, and collapsed into my bed. And like my stomach being so hungry that I could not eat, my mind was so hazed that I could not sleep. I could not dream. I longed to voyage into a new world, willingly leaving George and Lucas and Jenny and my parents and everyone else behind, for alongside them, my life was blander than the blandest of dreams that many a morning I’d lust returning to. After all, what insane man drinks from a river by day and the fountain of youth by night? But how much more fulfilling that fountain would be if I could savor it in reality! There was no more dominating a desire than to find out George’s secret. That was all that pulled me out of bed when the alarm rang.</p>
<p>We were going to run our usual route, down and about to my house under a darkening sky. It was different, though. The shedding of our shirts were but a formality without an overhead sun. Only the road would be usual in any sense, apart from the usual unusuality, for no two runs are ever the same. While the roads stayed still, the story in my head changed each time, and I was a subtly different man than the one before. But George… if any man changed that day, it was him. The look in his eyes—straight under furrowed brows—and the knotting of his shoes—not in the method but in his jerking motions—meant he was going to <i><b>run</b></i>. It was the runner’s high, the masculine necessity, and the adrenaline from pent up anger building in his heart that he hid beneath his breast.</p>
<p>“Today is the day,” George said, “that I’m beating my P.R.” He pulled his ankles to his glutes one after the other as we waited for Lucas. “I bet you that if I succeed, you have to tell me what’s been going on.”</p>
<p>“Not fair,” I said, “I asked you first and I’m still waiting for an answer. Tell me, what is your secret?”</p>
<p>“What’s yours?” George returned, raising his watch and beeping its buttons.</p>
<p>Lucas returned and gave the nod to start. George set his timer and began down the sidewalk knowing I’d race behind.</p>
<p>Lucas and I tried to keep pace, but we knew it would be futile. We were forced to watch him increase the distance between us minute by minute until he was only in sight on long stretches of road.</p>
<p>Nothing ever feels real</p>
<p>When real is undefined</p>
<p>My dreams are yearnings</p>
<p>And my life, lifeless</p>
<p>Only a thin, vast line</p>
<p>Holds the mind in place</p>
<p>But when the mind is hazed</p>
<p>The line draws evermore thin</p>
<p>The essence of dreams leak</p>
<p>And slip into reality</p>
<p>A car swerved past us, vibrating across the rumble strip on the shoulder. Its mirror was so close to my arm that I felt the air pressure change between it and I. Goosebumps crawled along my skin. Through the windows of the Cadillac, a man in a suit typed on his phone as he rushed home from work. I moved a step further from the lane. The car continued down the road and swerved around the corner onto the bridge over the dam—the two mile marker from my house. The run was nearing its end. George was still out of sight.</p>
<p>Tires screeched, plastic crunched, and an engine howled into the distance. Lucas cursed under his breath. On the day of George’s grand run, we would have to stop. I hoped George was so far ahead that turning back for the accident was too trivial to bother.</p>
<p>We rounded the corner towards the bridge, expecting to catch the driver of a wrecked car on the phone reporting a hit-and-run, but there was no sign anything had happened. Cars passed as casually as ever. The falling of a tree echoed throughout the forest yet no one had seen it. We questioned whether we heard the sound at all until someone coming from the opposite direction swung a U-turn onto the shoulder and activated their caution lights. A lady opened the door and peeked over the side of the dam where water was held back for the night. Lucas and I shot each other a look, confused. Lucas increased his pace.</p>
<p>A few uneasy moments passed before we finally reached her. In front of her car were bits of plastic and chipped paint beneath a slightly dented railing that was impossible to catch from far away.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Lucas questioned.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she sputtered. “I thought I saw something go over.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, like a deer,” she said, waving curled fingers around in vague shapes. “I was down the road.”</p>
<p>I leaned over the edge into the dark. An empty feeling tightened my throat. I hated touching grimy railings but clenched it tight with sweaty hands. The streetlight poured from the road thirty feet below onto yellow leaves collected around the wall of the dam. Not a ripple disturbed the surface. Nothing was down there. I pulled back and looked at Lucas.</p>
<p>“Or like a runner?” Lucas asked. “Did you pass by a runner?”</p>
<p>“Was someone ahead of you two?” she asked.</p>
<p>Lucas whispered only slightly louder than the wind, “George,” then he screamed, “George!”</p>
<p>No response returned. Lucas vaulted over the railing and into the abyss. </p>
<p>Had he seen something that I hadn’t? In what world could he conclude George was down there? It wasn’t physically possible. If it was possible, it couldn’t be real.</p>
<p>Like the summers past when he’d jump in alongside George despite the signs that warned not to, I hesitated and opted to run back to the end of the bridge and scramble down the hill side onto the shoreline. Lucas resurfaced to breathe, splashed around, then dove back under. I climbed into the water and swam out to him.</p>
<p>The water was deeper than I thought—easily ten feet deep—and it was impossible to see in the dark. The light from above was merely ambient and did not pierce the blanket of leaves nor the exposed surface of the water after I swept the leaves aside. But between the two of us, we quickly felt about the area that anything would have fallen in and found nothing. Every minute that passed led to the relieving conclusion that if George had fallen, one of us would have found him, and that we were overreacting to a woman’s delusion. I only continued inattentively searching because Lucas’s panic quickened, and in my mind I giggled at the picture of how confused George would be waiting in my driveway, watching us show up a dozen minutes late soaked in dirty water. “Oh, we were just taking an early bath,” I’d say. Or maybe I could convince him a truck splashed a puddle of muddy water onto us while I was off-route chasing a cat. I doubt he’d care though, for beating a P.R. was as gratifying as it was a nasty process. It puts the body out of commission for days until one is ready to train for the next. He’d likely be collapsed in the grass next to the mailbox that marked the end of the route, watching the stars awaken one-by-one like bats, raccoons, foxes, and fireflies as the sun cycled away.</p>
<p>My absent-minded arm brushed something soft and cold drifting buoyantly beneath the leaves. I jerked back frightfully, accidentally splashing water into my face. I quickly wiped my eyes with clenched muscles ready to fight or flight. Was it a fish or a snake? Old trash tossed from a car window? A cluster of dead plants? Or—could it be my best friend?</p>
<p>I grabbed for it. My fingers wrapped around a limb. All doubt vanished. My heart sank.</p>
<p>I reached under George’s arms and hoisted him onto my chest and swam with ferocity back to shore. There was no air in my lungs to spare notifying Lucas. He noticed my sudden movement and swam past me. When my back ran into the lake’s edge, Lucas drug George from my arms onto the shore and started pumping his chest with enough force to break a rib. </p>
<p>I waded in disbelief observing Lucas, convinced that it was a dream I would be pulled from at any moment, that the sweat from the run was from too many blankets, that a hand would rustle me awake. But it was an oddly lucid dream. Time moved slowly and the world stayed stagnant. The water was too wet.</p>
<p>“Mickey, take over,” Lucas said a couple of minutes later. “I’m tired.”</p>
<p>I crawled onto the shore and positioned my hands on George’s bare chest. It was hard and soft and cold. It compressed proportionally to the force I applied and pushed back equally. I pressed my lips against his, pinched his nose, breathed into his lungs, and watched his chest rise. Tears clouded my vision. It was no dream. It was too real. Is that what a story felt like? Soggy grass, warm air, wandering thoughts, dim lights, buzzing gnats, biting mosquitoes, tired legs, tired arms, tired lungs, tired mind. Where was the music, where was the popcorn?</p>
<p>Lucas motioned for me to speed up. I pushed hard and fast, my fingers curling into his skin in anger.<i> I still need you, George. I need you to show me. How do you do it? What is your secret? How are you who you are?</i></p>
<p>But it wasn’t George. George was full of life and energy. Below my pumping arms was just an empty body, staring lifelessly at the sky as my sweat, water, and tears mixed into its own. </p>
<p>I thought about the years I spent alongside George: when we first met on the playground, when we exchanged numbers after he finally got a phone, when we got the cops called on us for not wearing shirts while running, the boyish cheer when he had his first kiss, the double dinners I’d have first at his house before mine, the late nights we spent doing homework with a bag of chips, the loud concerts, the state fairs, the long detentions, our neck-to-neck competitions, and his smirks after he'd win each one. It was not the big stories that I observed from afar but the small ones we shared.</p>
<p>Lucas took over and resumed the motions, switching with me in turns until sirens rang into the vicinity overhead. Paramedics rushed down the hillside and pushed us aside. Then the ambulance arrived, and the paramedics carried the body up the hill, into the ambulance, and off into the distance.</p>
<p>I hugged Lucas. He hugged me back. I wept. For several moments, I wept in his embrace witg my face buried in his neck like a child. A genuine weep forgotten in stale years. It felt good, like a massive weight was lifted off my shoulders, and was replaced by a slightly lighter one that was of an entirely different shape I was unaccustomed to carrying, the thin wire of a paint can sawing into my palms or a wide rock I couldn’t wrap my arms around—the weight of loss, anxiety, regret, and rage.</p>
<p>The police escorted Lucas and I up to the bridge sectioned off by yellow tape. News vans raced to begin reporting. A crowd gathered behind the tape. Cameras masked their faces. The city circled to tune in to the latest calamity so they could celebrate the findings that justified their bickering about the cruelty of God or the downfall of western society.</p>
<p>Where were they when Lucas and I were searching for George? Were they fighting to be the first to call 911? Where were they when George’s family needed help? Were they too busy counting the pennies saved up that they’d never spend anyway, as though they were reaching for a high score in a video game? They were so careless to do anything that it was as though their goal was to kill off the Lebedev’s one by one and partake like Colosseum spectators in the aftermath. I wanted to rip their phones from their hands and throw them into the water, then drive a gun to their temple and force them into their Mustangs and Grand Waggoneers to drive off the dry side of the dam, so that their friends and family could go chasing after to save them while I filmed from above in return.</p>
