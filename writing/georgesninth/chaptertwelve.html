<p>One of the foremost oddities I had come upon with the on-the-go repair shop were the occasional disparities between a person’s car and their home. When working from the stationary shop, I judged a person’s wealth by their car. I’d smoke their cigarettes and chew their gum and stash their loose change in my pocket. But often times, the cars on the street I lived were old civics while those on the streets Bobby drove me down were luxury BMWs, modded trucks, and new Jeeps with flashy rims that declared the wealth of Newport reached all it’s corners. It was a strange illusion crafted not by the wealthy flaunting their benevolence but by the rest pretending to have received it. </p><p>I could not call these people rich—a person who forgoes living in a nice area and a nice house despite being able to does not subsequently splurge on a nice car to showcase in their driveway—yet how many of them had I stolen from? The game of justice I played held little real merit and was merely a game, much like those who donate to scams do harm despite their intention. On the other hand, those with nice cars were not poor either, despite what shell of a house they lived in. Why, then, had Bobby pulled up to that house?</p><p>I removed the floor jacks from the back of the truck and rolled them towards the vintage gray Corvette parked in front of us, deciding to hold my tongue until Bobby finished speaking with the owner. The front door of the house closed shut. Bobby returned to me dutifully raising the car. Not a second after he retrieved the jack stacks did I question him, “why are we helping someone maintain a car they clearly can’t afford?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” he asked, kneeling to put a jack stand in place. “We’ve been doing that for weeks.”</p><p>“I mean, why are we fixing this car? When it is clear that he can easily sell it for a cheaper car when there are other people who don’t have the same luxury?”</p><p>“Do you think it is right to freely fix cars when people don’t even have homes for the winter?” Bobby grunted as he raised himself off the ground. “Go build homes if that’s what you so please.”</p><p>“There is a line, as arbitrary as it may be, and this is past it.”</p><p>“That line Hugo told you about?”</p><p>I nodded, rolling the jack around to the other side.</p><p>He flicked his hand. “You made that line yourself.”</p><p>“There is at the very least a gray area between who needs help and who doesn’t—you can’t deny that—and this is well beyond that.”</p><p>“We are here to fix cars, and if it is simply to save a man money, so be it. But not all of our deeds are about money despite what you think. Money is just a convenient middleman—or a strange formality in our case—that we remove out of courtesy. Don’t confuse that for the deed itself.”</p><p>I disguised my pause as positioning the jack. “If it is not for the money, then why are we here?”</p><p>“He is a friend of mine from church,” Bobby said. “Long ago, his wife bought the car for him to enjoy when they found out there was a chance he would only live a few more months. In the end, he survived, so they never sold it off, but she has since passed of old age and he’s probably not far behind.” </p><p>I finished raising the car. Bobby knelt to place the other jack stand, then stood and took a deep breath, dusting his hands against each other. I lowered the floor jack and moved it into the grass. </p><p>“I don’t think it was a waste of money back then,” he said, “And I don’t think he should get rid of it because it a burden to maintain. Sometimes our minds hold onto unreasonable things, but that doesn’t mean we should let them go for being unreasonable. Emotion is as much part to us as our rationale—and good thing too.”</p><p>Although I always asked Bobby questions, it was only because I knew he had an answer. I rarely agreed with him. But that point was not one that I needed to argue, if anyone knew me at all. Bobby and I each grabbed our respective wrenches from the back of the truck to take the wheels off. I ceased to continue questioning him as I collected my thoughts, but he continued regardless:</p><p>“Why does someone need a sob story for you to help them? Why can’t you just be gracious in your everyday life, indiscriminate and kindhearted?”</p><p>“I only have so much time, so I’d rather spend it on the infinite line of people who truly need it. It just doesn’t make sense to me to give gifts to those who already have the gift of wealth.”</p><p>“You think it is a gift?”</p><p>I jerked my head back. “Of course. What else would it be?”</p><p>Bobby motioned for me to remove the tire and waited for me to roll it into the grass beside the floor jack, then asked, “How would you define what a gift is?”</p><p>After a moment, I said, “To receive something valuable.”</p><p>“Without expectation to give back something in return, no?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah, I suppose.”</p><p>“Well, it’s a very important distinction. You’re only fooling yourself if your reasoning is swayed by a misunderstanding of words. So, do you agree with that definition or no?”</p><p>“Yes, I do.”</p><p>“Alright,” he said, leaning against the truck. “You believe that those who have money can fix many problems in the world without having to face problems in return. I can’t disagree with that. No one can. But then we look around and see the problems persist and those people continue to amass their hoard of wealth and we wonder if those people are indeed evil to not bat an eye at human suffering. Tell me, can someone be evil if they cannot see the suffering unfold?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” I asked, eager to listen.</p><p>“Let’s say there are two ways of becoming rich. The first pertains to you: to be born into wealth. If someone is born into it, they can never understand what poverty is like—unless they become poor—so they will not understand the struggles of poverty. Much like the person who can hear cannot understand what it is like to never hear, or the kid with supporting parents never understand what it means to not have parents.”</p><p>“But I can see the pain of—”</p><p>“I don’t mean to be rude, but from the first day I took you out, I knew you hadn’t the faintest idea of what it truly meant to not have money.”</p><p>“I still sympathize with them.”</p><p>“Like a noble to a peasant. It is pity that you have, and no one wants your pity, I can tell you that.”</p><p>I looked to the ground and nodded.</p><p>“I don’t consider you to be cruel, just naive, and somewhat blind, although less so than you were when I first met you.”</p><p>“Well, thanks I guess.”</p><p>“For someone who holds empathy as high of a value as you do, don’t you think it wouldn’t be a gift being born into a rich family such that you might remain blind to that value called empathy?”</p><p>“Yes, I wouldn’t want to be blind to any moral of mine no matter how much peace of mind it might bring.”</p><p>“And if you were to live a prosperous life because of your family, do you think it would be paradoxical to hold the value of empathy above wealth yet remain in wealth? Therefore it is no more of a gift than if you weren’t born into wealth at all, because you would have given it away for the sake of empathy?”</p><p>The old, sly snake knew my answer and was forcing me to voice it to someone other than myself. The pretentiousness of it—the natural reticence of voicing an unspoken conviction—lobbed its way into my throat. “Yes. I would like to think that I would live at a reasonable comfort without putting others beneath me.”</p><p>“I respect the thought,” Bobby said. “Where you will actually draw that line remains to be seen. But we will say it is where you placed it. So then, you would agree that being born into wealth is neither inherently evil nor a gift?”</p><p>I paused. It was a strange question that seemed far more convoluted than for it’s own good, simplifying a complex argument into a yes or no after rounds of word salad. Surely there was a leak of logic or miscalculated rationale, but I wasn’t paying close enough attention to point it out it. I only had the option to agree. “I guess so,” I said, hoping that would be the end of it.</p><p>“The other way of becoming rich is to mindlessly pursue it,” Bobby continued. “Someone does not become rich simply by working as hard as everyone else. No, they need to make it the most important thing in their life. It is therefore a requisite that money becomes more important than sympathy, or others without the same sense of sympathy will out-compete them. One only needs to look to the plantations of past Newport to know that much.”</p><p>“You don’t consider a plantation to be evil?”</p><p>“I do, and we can agree that it is not a gift to be evil as we have already established.”</p><p>“Yes, I think so.”</p><p>“Let’s then only consider the people who are wealthy but not necessarily cruel to others. These people work long days consumed by output, and what remains left of their days are spent resting their mind so they can continue as soon as possible. Naturally, these people would be too busy working to contemplate the hurt in the world, and it would require significant contemplation to give away what they worked for after working as hard as they did for it. Do you think it is a fair statement to say these people would be blind to the suffering?”</p><p>“Yes, if that’s how money becomes the most important thing in their life.”</p><p>“And do you consider these people evil?”</p><p>“No, since we already established that being blind is not evil.”</p><p>“Exactly, “ Bobby said, pointing his finger at me. “And do you consider working your entire life away to be a gift?”</p><p>“No,” I replied, “if you do not like the job. But what if you like the job?”</p><p>“You could consider the love of work to be a gift, but it does not mean the consequent wealth itself is a gift. Much like your passion to run could be considered a gift, but the body you attained from that is one you earned.”</p><p>“Where are you going with this?” I asked, exhausted. “You are confusing me.”</p><p>“My point is that that which is attained is defined almost entirely by how it was attained. There are a thousand different paths we can take that lead to wealth—some may be evil or a gift, others may be absurd, noble, rational, deranged, virtuous, or even transcendental. But that is what makes stories, journeys, and adventures so alluring to you, because they define your place in the world. And if it is not defined, then it is meaningless.”</p><p>For others to formulate into words my actions before I realized the words myself belittled the words, yet for the words to then explain my actions meant the actions themselves were belittled as well. And once the mystery is explained away, the surrounding thoughts are nullified as there is no more contemplation to be done. It just is.</p><p>“I don’t think you believe these things yourself,” I said.</p><p>“Not like you do,” Bobby replied. “You tout charity above all else, but I have bills to pay, a family to feed, and a retirement to look forward to. Your crises are exhausting and better dealt with when you are young—eager and full of energy.”</p><p>“Then what do you believe? Do you think it is an evil path to abandon virtue for comfort?”</p><p>“Do you think it is evil to be a Nazi soldier when your neighbors are taken away, knowing that if you refused, your parents, brothers, sisters, spouse, and children would be taken away too?”</p><p>“That is an absurd comparison.”</p><p>“And even in an absurdity, I do not know what evil is, nor what path I would take if I knew the answer. Yet, that is where your morals truly show.”</p><p>It was unnerving that even someone as understanding as Bobby wouldn’t know himself. What that made everyone else was terrifying.</p><p>“I don’t blame people who prefer comfortable lives,” he said, “but if you consider ridding yourself the stress of car payments, mortgage, and healthcare costs to be worth being blind, then that is the choice you make. But it is not a gift to take that path, nor to not take it, so much as it is to choose any other path. I believe we have no right to declare which path is the correct one. We only have the right to choose to either hate or understand those who think otherwise.”</p><p>Bobby stopped, satisfied with his words. When I did not say anything in return, he double-tapped the fiberglass top of the car and left to retrieve the remaining tools from the truck so we could return to work. </p><p>He always concluded his rants on notes of compassion. The simple, warm themes allured me. Not because they were easy to follow—it was extraordinarily difficult to be all-understanding—but because when someone preaches of compassion, it is hard to disagree unless spite leaves it as the only option. I did not spite Bobby. But I did not believe what he believed either. My own intuition said otherwise and I did not know why. How could I not know? It was my intuition!</p><p>I clenched my fist. My eyes watered like a child who didn’t get what they wanted. When Bobby returned, I wiped the tears off like sweat and took the wrench from his hand.</p>
