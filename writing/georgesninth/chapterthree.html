								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Three</h1><br>
<p>I did not ever rest at night. My sleep was an inescapable tease. Each dream was a new life sprung from the deep desires of my imagination, wandering through what a life of George would be like—the besiegement of ancient castles, an inexplicable royal romance, a voyage to find the fountain of youth such that my death would never be so. But even the fountain of youth did not save me from the snapping return to reality, where the waves of the sea crashed into puddles of sweat on my bedsheet.</p>
<p>I fell asleep with too thick of blankets. Too much warmth, too deep of a slumber. My skin was wet to the touch. I dried myself off with the towel I set on my nightstand, its rough coat itching my body awake, wiping away the remnants of my lost life. But my passion of the thrill was not so easily lost. The stories were imagined; the emotions were not. My dreams spilt forth into the world as so. It was only the conditioning of thousands of reiterations of the same loss that kept them at bay.</p>
<p>I did not know if anyone else had those dreams. It would have been bold to claim so. Thus, the question was, why was I the only one who struggled to pull myself out of bed, to internally weep at my loss? Why was I the only one who lusted for another, truer dream upon waking? Was I a naïve fool or just a child?</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Dad worked at the mechanic shop off of highway twenty-two. It was as unexciting as it sounded: a gray block plopped on a patch of Kentucky-blue grass, flanked by one great wing outstretched like a swan herding its sputtering children—although the metaphor is attributed to the wing’s function and not the insulting aesthetic. It was the architecture of an engineer who designed such an economical structure that his mundane imagination was extraordinary in comparison, and as much of a stench as the roadway system of suburban cities that it so proudly nurtured. A swan’s wings are also purely utilitarian; Are they not simultaneously beautiful? Yet the symbol of angels is blasphemed into synonymity with Highway Twenty-Two Auto Care. </p>
<p>I hated cars—a mandatory expression of an individual who had no interest in expressing, as hair and clothes and homes—and the fact that my dad worked as a mechanic was the only fact of him I was disappointed about. </p>
<p>Dad’s keys clinked against the tinted glass door of the shop as he turned its lock. As the door chimed open, the redeeming aroma of oil, plastic, and paint spilled out. It was the aroma of a home where mini-Mickey would quell his terrible tantrum fits back in the much smaller garage at the house, when, as a child, Dad would take me to the garage to turn a few bolts or pull a battery out with all the muscle my body had given me. I would be too busy with my hands to cry, and I hoped that I would soon be too busy to reminisce over the dream of the past night.</p>
<p>The lobby was segregated by a long desk that spanned its width, just past a door that led into the garage. An array of worn faux-leather chairs lined the walls of the front. A TV lifelessly hung overhead a table occupied by a cold coffee machine. As I helped Dad settle in, his co-workers followed suit one-by-one, backing their cars into the employee parking spots. </p>
<p>The first drove a truck that appeared to be far older than me, pridefully maintained through the years. It was owned by a decrepit lumberjack with long grizzled hair and blue jean overalls, whose name I later learned to be Bobby. He hobbled in through the glass door and outstretched his hand to me. “You must be Mickey.”</p>
<p>“That’s me,” I said, shaking his hand, “ready to get this day over with.”</p>
<p>Bobby met my dry, dull, pitiful humor with a frown. “That’s no way to look at it. Is this how Mr. Lee raised you?”</p>
<p>Dad smiled behind the counter, sorting documents without a word, withdrawn from the question asked to me, but his sorting slowed as his attention shifted in anticipation of my answer. I could tell, as it was not long ago when I feverishly listened to a boy flirt with a barista, and similarly all concentration from my work dwindled.</p>
<p>I didn’t have an answer, however, and was relieved of needing one when the door jingled open to the next coworker whose truck was comically parked the next spot over, dwarfing the older model, spotless and modified and yet with the same color of the craft. He had his crew cut and polo shirt and jeans, a copy and paste of every other guy, and was as so uninspiring as I to wash my care for him away.</p>
<p>The third was… a small white sedan plucked straight off the used car lot, its chips and age familiar. The kind of car that you could tell, somehow, that it before required long Saturdays in the driveway with its propped hood a shade from the hot sun. So was it not fair of me to assume George’s sister had come to get some early morning work done before her shift at the café, in a real garage better equipped to deal with the work a car like hers would need? Yet she backed into the third spot buttressing the second.</p>
<p>When she pushed through the tinted glass door, stuffing her sunglasses in her bag, she paused upon catching my eyes. I didn’t know what to say. It was one of those phrases I couldn’t respond to—only wordless. Should I have told her to just pull into the nearest garage? Or that she could have texted me and I would have helped for free? Or should I have told her we’re not open yet?</p>
<p>It was Dad who spoke first, finally emerging from behind the counter. “Morning Jenny,” he said. It was uncomfortably out of place as I wasn’t aware he even knew who Jenny was.</p>
<p>“Morning, Mr. Lee,” she replied, then re-established our awkward eye contact, but only for a second before darting away again. “Morning Mickey. Didn’t know you’d be here.”</p>
<p>“Nor did I,” I said.</p>
<p>“You had a good drive over here?” Dad asked. “Traffic isn’t as bad on Saturday mornings.”</p>
<p>“I learned my lesson last time,” Jenny said, “not to get here half an hour before everyone else.”</p>
<p>My dad continued speaking to Jenny in a manner that proclaimed I wasn’t involved in the conversation, like my decision wasn’t involved in me coming to work, and he spoke like I was still his mindless, semi-conscious kid he was handing off to someone else. Every step since I let him initiate the conversation while I fumbled a response led to me being further and further partitioned from their conversation. Only he would I have ever allowed to treat me that way.</p>
<p>“Mickey is going to be joining us,” Dad said. “It’s his first day, so I’m entrusting you to show him the ropes.”</p>
<p><i>Show me the ropes?</i> I choked. How long had the strange relationship between my dad and George’s sister been going on?</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” Jenny said, then set her bag behind the desk and motioned for me to follow her through the door to the garage which, apropos of a jingle, opened and closed with a creak.</p>
<p>The garage was dark except for the incandescent light that hummed above the door behind us. Jenny flipped a series of switches that lit five sections in sequence, and similarly pressed a row of buttons that lifted each steel door to the ceiling. The sunlight painted the room with an inching coat across the concrete floor, over the tools and tires, and up our shoes and legs and torsos to momentarily blind our eyes as the doors slowly lifted in tune to regulations. By the time my sight adjusted, Jenny had weaved through three stations as one would by memory in their home past midnight. Each section was occupied by vehicles I would’ve damaged had I blindly attempted to follow her: a black truck with lifts, a white BMW with shiny new rims, and an old, gray Honda Civic. It was absolutely colorless.</p>
<p>“There’s some cars left overnight that we can start on,” she said, her voice carrying from the far side as she flicked through sheets on a clipboard picked up during the flash.</p>
<p>“What’s on the agenda?” I asked, making my way to her.</p>
<p>She clicked a pen and scribbled in boxes. No answer came, and then it was too long of a pause to repeat the question. When I reached her, I cleared my throat and tried again. “Anything important?”</p>
<p>She stared at the pages without a word, so I moved to her side to read alongside her only to find her hair curtaining the page from my view. Then she dropped the clipboard to her side and started walking.</p>
<p>“I can tell you’ve tinkered with your car,” I said, catching her stride.</p>
<p>“Mhmm.”</p>
<p>“You ever work on your car here?” I asked, “You know, now that you work here?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>When we reached the Civic, Jenny unlocked her phone and started taking pictures around the car’s perimeter, nudging me aside to get better angles as I shadowed her.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with the car?”</p>
<p>“It needs new brake pads,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“Why take pictures if all they need is new brake pads?”</p>
<p>She sighed and lowered her phone. “You see that mark right there? It’s so they can’t claim we did it.” Then she jotted more on the clipboard, taking note of other specifications.</p>
<p>“They only came in for brake pads?”</p>
<p>She shook her head and remained blankly focused with her pen. Reserved as though she were still in the background of George’s life. I didn’t know if that’s how she saw herself, but that’s how I saw her. I might have said that about everyone else in the world, but especially her, for from the moment I saw her, I thought of George. My heart ached to ask her how he was doing. But she never gave me the chance.</p>
<p>She set the clipboard on a cart and pressed a button. The car lifted off the ground. “It needs other work too, but that’s above our paygrade.”</p>
<p>“So, they put us on the easy work?”</p>
<p>“They put <i>you</i> on it.” She searched through the drawers of the cart then pulled out a torque wrench. “To take off a tire, just push this button and it’ll unscrew the nut.” She ran it in the air before kneeling and wrestling it on. But it wouldn’t fit.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t fit because the 19-mm socket was still in the drawer, next to an empty slot of a smaller size. I chuckled and handed her the socket; she snatched it in a fluster. And much like when a child learns to finally elicit attention from their mother, or a detective a response from a suspect, I took note to repeat as soon as I could. So when she tucked her hair back behind her ear after jerking it out of place, I wanted to see, to test and taste what it was like to rustle her feathers just a little more. </p>
<p>“You should probably tie your hair back as well.”</p>
<p>Her fists clenched by her side. “I haven’t had the chance because I didn’t think I’d have to show you how to take off a damn tire!” </p>
<p>I smiled and leaned against a pillar, folding my arms and crossing my legs. “Oh, Jenny. You’ve known me long enough to know I meant nothing by it.”</p>
<p>She grunted. “Hardly.”</p>
<p>It was true. We shared few memories together, none of which were worth remembering. Her being at the table in the café that day was pure happenstance and might have given us both the wrong idea of our relationship with the vulnerabilities we spilt then. There was one time, however, when George and I were working under the hood of his car in his driveway after school, tools littering the pavement behind us. It was a task far more complicated than removing a tire. Another car stopped on the curb behind us, and Jenny emerged from the passenger side door in her café uniform. She walked around the front of the car as the driver rolled down his window, and the two of them chatted as I listened keenly. When I looked over my shoulder, the car drove away, and Jenny and I locked eyes as she passed me. She then only looked back one last time before disappearing inside the house.</p>
<p>We at least shared that memory. It was in her eyes—an inconsequential moment suddenly resurfacing, the one we both knew proved the absurdity of her assumptions about me. Yet the memory went unspoken, and the roleplay continued. She treated me like an idiot, and I feigned ignorance. Her tick remained an unsolved puzzle I loved piecing together.</p>
<p>“Might you want to get to know me then?” I asked. </p>
<p>The wrench churned about the rim, then Jenny threw me a lug nut and the wrench. “Do that in a star pattern,” she said, “and I’ll show you how to take off the brake pad.”</p>
<p>“If we’re going to be co-workers,” I said, “I at least would like to know you, were you to give me the time of day.”</p>
<p>“Well apparently, we’ve known each other long enough.”</p>
<p>“Even so, I never took you for a car person.”</p>
<p>“Because I’m a girl?” she spat.</p>
<p>Ah! Jenny, you little anxious ant. Is that what it was? Desperately trying to fit into a role she thought she didn’t belong?</p>
<p>“Not at all,” I replied. “It’s just George doesn’t know the first thing about them.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not George.”</p>
<p>“Neither am I,” I said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>I took her place and followed her orders. The worries of the outside world ceased to exist. Intuitively, the relief was a result of the whirring on the wrench and the accumulation of dirt upon my fingertips; empirically, however—undeniably, and paradoxically—it was the untangling of Jenny’s perplexities. Was it similar for her too, that her attempt at mentorship was her means of distraction? Because the shop was no longer the respite it should have served as with us both there. No wonder her bitterness! We were, me to her and her to I, reminders of George and thus of the Lebedev family tragedy.</p>
<p>I collected the nuts and spilled them on the cart, circling and rolling like marbles, colliding with the wrench I laid in their path, and then tugged the tire off. </p>
<p>Jenny then stepped forward and said, before I could rid myself of the tire and whilst her body completely blocked the view, “The brake pad is under this thing here—” If she was trying to teach me, she was doing horrendously. But I was too interested in the game she was playing. She rambled on and I nodded along, amused by her act, her squirming about in the wheel well to hide herself as I whittled away at her mask bit by bit. I imagined it to be like meeting George all over again, but she was an entirely confounded version of him—as equally lost as I. </p>
<p>“Do that on both sides,” she said, “and that’s it. They expect it to be ready by eight, so you have…” she checked her watch, “less than twenty minutes.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to help?”</p>
<p>“Do you need help?”</p>
<p>“I might.”</p>
<p>For the second time all morning, her eyes met mine. She lifted her eyebrow and put her two hands on her hips—still doubtful, still reticent, yet receptive. </p>
<p>“And I’d enjoy your company,” I added.</p>
<p>Was it a hint of a smile I saw?</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Jenny’s toil through the morning was a spectacle. Inspections became a fluency. Oil changes a habit. Battery replacements routine. Juxtaposed to her, it was as if all I did was watch from afar. Still, it did not matter how hard she worked. Time ticked till lunch, cars cycled ceaselessly, yet her problems persisted in the foreground—the demons namelessly lurking—as she distracted herself with the notion that determination at a task would scare them away regardless of the task at hand. Her demons were a contagious dilemma that, at my clawing of her mask, sprung like jumping fleas prodding needles in my scalp, and upon ripping them out, screamed from my fists as a deafening circus of cicadas, “Not here, not there, but nowhere!”, and when I thrust them on the ground and stomped them out like a cigarette, the fire flicked furiously from beneath my sole and an army of ants swarmed my legs such that each smack and swipe of my hands only spread them across my palms and up my wrists and arms—an insufferable infection, for that’s what masks were. They hid those who practiced other than what they preached, who laughed at my lust for George despite their very own cries for a good story, and who laughed at poor George when they had the money to make his problems go away, and yet carried themselves as if they rightfully belonged in this society. <i>Who are you really?</i>—that is the question that haunted me—<i>I want to know you, Jenny.</i></p>
<p>“You need something?” she asked, catching my gaze from the other side of a black car she had lifted slightly off the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s lunch time,” I said.</p>
<p>She nodded and disappeared behind the front fender. From an angle, I could see beneath the car where her laces dangled over her curled toes. A wrench churched, lugnuts sprinkled her shoes, and a tire fell in front. Then her head poked back out and she clunked the wrench atop the hood.</p>
<p>“Do you want to eat together?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m working.”</p>
<p>“Tire rotation?”</p>
<p>“Tire replacement,” she said, rolling the tire to the tire changer machine. She removed the tire’s valve stem and a piercing hiss of air ensued.</p>
<p>I tucked my nail into the dusty crease of a tread from the opposite side; I couldn’t reach the bottom. I dragged my finger along the rubber and popped a pebble out of place, its skittering into sunlight silenced by the quickly fading hiss, and when the final pounces of the pebble were heard alas, I asked, “What’s wrong with these?”</p>
<p>“They could afford new tires.”</p>
<p>The rear tire was a fresh black compared to the front one I fiddled. So, I took the wrench and began removing the front one as Jenny taught me.</p>
<p>“I can finish it on my own,” she said.</p>
<p>I smiled at her and continued dizzying the wrench without reply. As perfectly as she demonstrated. </p>
<p>“Seriously,” she repeated, “go enjoy your break.”</p>
<p>“I am.” I tugged off the tire and rolled it around to the machine, using her tool to release the tire’s air. Even with the loud hiss of a black-ring snake by her feet, she pretended to not notice me. The hallmark of our partnership! We’d meet eyes, and she would dart away before I could smile. I joked, and she only sometimes gave a nod. And no matter how quickly I worked, she was faster—a pit crew collapsed into a single individual that raced to leave my presence. It was utterly irritating.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a long semester,” I said, “I’m not going to let you keep pushing yourself like this.”</p>
<p>Jenny, having finished her fresh tire, nearly landed it on my toes had I not pulled away. “Or what?” she questioned, “You’re going to stop me?”</p>
<p>“I’ll help you through all these tasks until there’s nothing left to do, then yes, you’ll be forced to take a break.”</p>
<p>She rolled hers away; I hoisted mine in place. The process of changing a tire is quite tedious. The details are best spared. But by the time I finished, Jenny was inside helping the customer. I lowered the car and headed inside past rows of white and black cars lifted at various heights. The guy whose name I couldn’t care to remember was still tinkering with a gray one. When I entered the lobby, Jenny passed by me alongside the customer she was leading back to their vehicle. The lobby was then otherwise empty. I checked the list on the clipboard Jenny left behind. Nothing was left to do. She was out of luck. I washed my hands in the sink and grabbed my brown-bagged lunch before chasing after her. </p>
<p>From the far side, the car pulled away, leaving a clueless Jenny standing in the empty space. She stared at the ground, only jolting at my approaching footsteps.</p>
<p>“If we’re going to be working together,” I repeated with an Oreo outstretched,” I would at least like to get to know you.”</p>
<p>“Would you just leave me alone?” she snapped as though I were a shadow she could not shake and slapped the Oreo from my hand. “Why can’t you get the hint?” </p>
<p>The hint? The lie? She pushed past me to help the other mechanic two spots back work through lunch. He shook his head at me.</p>
<p>Were the bits beneath my nails truly streaks of her mask or simply shavings of her skin? Or, might her mask have been her skin, her blood and bones—could I have cut her heart out and not find her soul within? Oh, how stubborn I was! It was my own skin that stung and bled, my cheeks and scalp and legs and arms. All the fleas and cicadas and ants were butterflies tickling my lungs longing to find George in the mess of the girl on the far side of the garage, but she promised he was not there.</p>
<p>I kicked the bits of crumbled Oreo into the parking lot and left to find a place to eat lunch on my own.</p>
