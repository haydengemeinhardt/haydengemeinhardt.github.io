								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Three</h1><br>
<p>I really thought I’d wake up in the morning and painfully drag myself out of bed, but I was surprisingly refreshed. It was the last day of September and I absolutely loved September and I didn’t want to spoil the one last good day I had left of it.</p>
<p>I rode with my dad to the shop, open at 7:30 AM, which even though I had been getting to school for that time every day for my entire life, I was still not used to. Every Friday night spent staying up late playing video games undid any progress I made towards a consistent lifestyle. Was it worth it? On Friday nights, hell yeah.</p>
<p>But today was Saturday morning and on top of staying up late shooting demons on Doom, the anxiety from showing up to an actual job the next day kept me tossing in bed, flipping the pillow that was ceaselessly hot on each side and wrangling with my covers as though it were a Mobius strip. </p>
<p>I was going under the wing of my father so I really had nothing to worry about. He’d give me the ins and outs of everything and, growing up as the son of a mechanic, I knew what there was to know about fixing cars. I was expecting at least an awkward car ride after last night, yet there wasn’t even that.</p>
<p>“Don’t be nervous,” Dad said, slamming the door of his truck shut. “As long as you don’t do anything absurdly idiotic, you’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“That’s the problem though,” I replied. “Ninety-nine percent of the time I know my way like a professional, but every now and then I’ll do something stupid.”</p>
<p>“By absurdly idiotic, I mean you’d have to throw a wrench at the windshield, fill the tank with nutella, and casually loosen the lugnuts before sending them on their way.”</p>
<p>“I am beyond certain I can and will do at least two of those three things by lunch.”</p>
<p>The keys jingled against the glass door as my dad turned the lock. The door opened to the smell of a car shop that every car shop in existence has had since the beginning of their existence, as though some discrete trade secret passed between them to create the smell. It wasn’t oil or rust or rubber. It was the smell of a home, in a way. Where a man can push aside all other burdens in life, escape the thoughts of nihilism, and simply work. </p>
<p>That’s what I liked about working on cars with my father as we used to when I was younger. When I would get upset, he’d take me out to turn a few bolts or pull a battery out with all the muscle my body had given me at that point. I was busy enough with my hands that I couldn’t cry if I needed to. Even growing up, if I ever needed to let off steam, I’d rotate tires that didn’t need rotating or help him fix a broken window motor. So I knew, as soon as I stepped foot in that garage, the anxiety about fucking up or the thoughts spinning as to what I’d do with myself if our group fell apart with George’s mother’s death… I knew those thoughts would fade in the grease.</p>
<p>As I helped my dad settle in, a couple of other workers started pulling in. One of them drove a truck that was probably his first that he took pride in maintaining throughout the years to see how long it’d last. The other pulled in, also in a truck, but one that was spotless and modified to the point that you would be able to tell he also felt pride in his craftsmanship. As different as those two trucks looked parked next to each other–backed into their spots as all truck drivers do–they showed one in the same type of person. People like my dad who felt content with living his life buried in a car. </p>
<p>It was what Dad claimed was a necessity for men. Not cars, per se. Any type of craftsmanship would do for any type of man–carpentry, painting, metal-work, music, sculpting, dance–it just varied in how one came to find their niche. A skill you could be proud of was what mattered. Unfortunately, he didn’t consider running to be a skill.</p>
<p>While the second man stayed in his car, the first man walked in. He was tall with long gray hair, a soul patch, and a bit of weight on the belly that comes with age. He didn't look old, maybe sixty, but I could tell from appearance alone that he was the one with the beaten truck out front. He smiled with crooked, glazing-white teeth when he saw me. "You must be Mickey.”</p>
<p>"That's me." I reached my hand out to shake his. "Ready to get this day over with."</p>
<p>He frowned. "That's no way to look at it…”</p>
<p>I groaned internally and prepared for the lecture. I should have kept my mouth shut. Sarcastic jokes never paired well with older people. They always tried to throw some life-changing advice in or think your joke was a legitimate display of your stupidity.</p>
<p>Through the front window I saw a third car pull in. I knew this car. It was George’s sister’s–Jenny’s. It was a small, white sedan that looked plucked straight off the used car lot. It wasn’t beat up or dirty, but you could just tell, somehow, that it required at least a couple of occasions where hands dug under the hood, either pulled over on the side of the road or for a long Saturday in the driveway under the heat of the sun doing what needed to be done. At first, I thought George’s sister was just coming to get some work done on the car early before she needed to go back to the cafe, but she pulled in right next to the trucks and walked to the door like she had already done it a million times before.</p>
<p>When she pulled open the tinted glass door into the office part of the building, taking off her sun glasses and stuffing them in her bag, she looked up and we caught eyes. I didn’t know what to say. It was like one of those phrases I couldn’t respond to, except wordless. Should I have said if you need work done, you can just pull into the nearest garage or you could have just texted me if you needed something or a simple we aren’t open yet? I was standing there like that time long ago when George first outburst to us, cycling through countless phrases in my head wondering what to say, and when each phrase led to some terrible outcome, I decided to stay silent and see what was up.</p>
<p>But it was my dad who spoke first. “Morning Jenny,” he said, which felt uncomfortably out of place because I wasn’t sure he even knew who Jenny was.</p>
<p>“Morning Mr. Lee.” She replied, then re-established our awkward eye contact. “Morning Mickey. Didn’t know you’d be here.” </p>
<p>“Nor did I, to be honest.”</p>
<p>“You had a good drive over here?” Dad asked Jenny. “Traffic is not so bad on a Saturday morning.”</p>
<p>“I learned my lesson last time,” Jenny said, “not to get here half an hour before everyone else.”</p>
<p>My dad continued speaking to Jenny in a manner that said I wasn’t involved in the conversation. Like my decision wasn’t involved in me coming here… which it wasn’t. And he spoke like I was still his semi-mindful kid he was handing off to someone else, and every step since I let him initiate the conversation while I fumbled a response led to me being further and further partitioned from their conversation. Only he could have treated me that way.</p>
<p>He was still at that point where he didn’t want to accept that I was grown. He treated me the same as he always had as people tend to treat the people they know as they always had from first perception. But I wasn’t still a mindless child, despite what I made it seem at times. I was seventeen. </p>
<p>“Anyway, Mickey is going to be joining us. It’s his first day, so I’m entrusting you to show him the ropes.”</p>
<p>Show me the ropes? How long has this strange relationship between my dad and George’s sister been going on?</p>
<p>“Yes sir.” Jenny said, then set her bag behind the desk and motioned to me to follow her through another glass door that opened and closed with a creak. It felt like someone was trying to guide me through my own home–a home I hadn’t been to since Dad last convinced younger me to go to work with him. That was years ago. Long enough that the garage didn’t look the same.</p>
<p>The garage itself was dark except for the light that came from behind us. Jenny flipped a series of switches that lit up the five sections in sequence, and similarly pressed a row of buttons that lifted each steel door up to the ceiling to let the sunlight paint the room with an inching coat across the floor, over the tools, and up the walls. Three sections still had cars sitting in the space–a black truck with lifts, a white BMW with shiny new rims, and an old, gray Honda Civic on the far side. It was absolutely colorless.</p>
<p>“There’s some cars left overnight that we can start on.” Jenny walked me around the side where the doors still slowly lifted in tune to regulations to their height. Cars periodically passed by, door motors churned their gears, and neither of us said a word. She had grown to complete silence since we left the lobby.</p>
<p>“I can tell you’ve tinkered with your car,” I said, trying to break the silence.</p>
<p>“Mhmm.”</p>
<p>We kept walking.</p>
<p>“You ever worked on your car here? You know, now that you work here?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>I guess a little morning quietude wasn’t bad. It was unusual, actually. Anytime I was ever up this early in the morning, I was either getting ready while Dad loudly fried eggs and Mom blared the television to get her taste of politics for the day, or beginning the day at school. And while the bus ride would always be dead silent in the dead of morning–Lucas listening to music, George thinking of his grand story, and me finishing last-minute homework–as soon as we got to school, noise erupted in the hallways and courtyards. Being here made it seem like life was less chaotic without hallways of hormones..</p>
<p>As we reached the Civic, Jenny pulled out her phone and began taking pictures around the car’s perimeter.</p>
<p>“So what’s wrong with the car?”</p>
<p>“It needs new brake pads,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“Why take pictures if all they need is to replace the brake pads?”</p>
<p>She sighed and lowered her phone. “You see that mark right there? It’s so they can’t claim we did it.” Then she began jotting down on a clipboard, taking note of the mileage and other specifications.</p>
<p>“They only came in for brake pads? Looks like it could use some more work than that.”</p>
<p>She shook her head and continued blankly with the paperwork.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell what her deal was. Maybe she was always like this? I honestly did not know her all that well, only here and there in the background of George’s life.</p>
<p>She put down the clipboard and pressed a button to raise the car. Finally she spurted, “Daniel had worked on it yesterday before closing, but he said it needed new pads badly.”</p>
<p>“Ah so he put us on it. Kind guy.”</p>
<p>“He put you on it.” She picked up a torque wrench that had been hanging on the wall. “Anyway to take off a tire, just push this button and it’ll unscrew the nut,” she said, running it in the air before kneeling down and wrestling it on. But it wouldn’t go on.</p>
<p>I looked at the tool rack and grabbed the 19-mm socket next to the empty slot of socket sizes. A Honda Civic was not an exotic car to me–being native to the American roadways–so I knew the lug size by heart. Still, I couldn’t help but chuckle at the fact that she didn’t think to check the size first. I handed her the socket and she snatched it from my hand, flustered.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she said, tucking her hair behind her ear..</p>
<p>“You should probably have your hair tied up.”</p>
<p>She shot me a look. I should not have said that. “I haven’t had the chance because I didn’t think I’d have to show you how to take off a damn tire.”</p>
<p>Well, she didn’t have to and I’m sure she knew that, but I thought best to hold my tongue by this point.</p>
<p>“So do that in a star pattern,” she said, “and I’ll show you how to take off the brake pad.”</p>
<p>I knew how to change a brake pad. And she had to know I knew how, right? But I didn’t say anything. I kind of liked the idea of entertaining her for a bit.</p>
<p>I knelt down in front of the tire and spun the lugnuts off. “I’m surprised you know your way around cars. I didn’t take you for that kind of person.”</p>
<p>“Because I'm a girl?" she spat.</p>
<p>It took me aback for a second, until I realized how the comment might have come across as misogynistic to someone like her. She was desperately trying to fit into this role and environment that she had, in the last five minutes, convinced me was tense for her. "Not at all. It's just George doesn't know the first thing about them."</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not George.”</p>
<p>“Neither am I,” I said with a chuckle. If only she knew my thoughts on that. I finished taking the nuts off, then leaned the wrench against the wall and tugged the tire off. “It’s a nice hobby, huh?”</p>
<p>“So the brake pad is under this thing here…” she began explaining before I had even set the tire down. If she was trying to teach me, she was doing pretty bad at it. Then again, I wasn’t convinced she was actually trying to teach me how to do things. She kept explaining how to replace the pad and I just nodded, not really paying attention to her words anymore than I was watching her squirm around in the wheel well. George might not have liked cars, and George seemed to at least like me, but by God those two were so much alike other than that–which was ironic considering her previous comment. It was, in a way, like meeting George for the first time all over again.</p>
<p>It made me miss George because I hadn’t seen him since the run and had no idea how he was holding up with the news. As a matter of fact, I just kind of forgot about it the moment I stepped in here. It made me wonder if Jenny felt the same way, and her attempt at mentoring me was her way of distracting herself.</p>
<p> “Do that on both sides,” she continued, “and that’s it. They expect it to be ready by eight a.m., so you have,” she checked her watch, “less than twenty minutes.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to help?”</p>
<p>“Do you need more help?”</p>
<p>“No, I guess not.” I wasn’t sure why I even asked the question.</p>
<p>She sighed and fixed her hair once more. “I’m going to get some coffee. I’m sure the guys got a batch going. You want some?”</p>
<p>“Sure, thanks.”</p>
<p>Over her shoulder appeared another man. Short dark hair, dark brown eyes, and a smile of dark coffee-stained teeth. “Morning Jenny,” he said, then looked at me. “And you must be Mickey.”</p>
<p>“That’s me.” I reached up and shook his hand.</p>
<p>“I’m Daniel, nice to meet you.” His grip was firm and I wish I had thrust more than my fingers into his palm. “I see Jenny has you working on those brake pads.”</p>
<p>“They’ve definitely seen better days.”</p>
<p>“Your father always talked good things about you, so you better not let me down; I worked hard on this car.”</p>
<p>I saw Jenny shoot me that half-smile one gives when something is wrong but don’t want to bother you with it. I didn’t really know how to respond to that, but I didn’t have to as she walked away. </p>
<p>“Jenny is going to be showing me the ropes today, so I’m in her hands.”</p>
<p>He checked over his shoulder to see Jenny enter the lobby then looked back at me. “You know, she’s the sweetest thing. And hard working too. It’s a shame about her mother though.” </p>
<p>“Yeah.” I was shocked he knew. I always thought it to be a private topic, but I guess some people liked to talk through their problems rather than hide them.</p>
<p>“Well, listen Mickey, if you ever need help, give me a holler.”</p>
<p>“Will do Daniel.”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>I had just finished helping the last customer in the lobby when I checked the time. 12:30. I turned to Jenny who was loosening lugnuts on a black Lexus.</p>
<p>Watching Jenny work throughout the morning was an interesting feat. Changing tires became a fluency. AC checks a habit. Battery replacements routine. Any diagnostic or high cost work was left to the more experienced guys, though sometimes she helped out on that too if she had already breezed through the other tasks. She seemed to be the only one around here who actually cared to work–because she knew she had to. She had to prove that it was not a mistake giving the job to an incoming junior in high school.</p>
<p>“Jenny, it’s lunch time.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m just finishing this last customer.”</p>
<p>“Tire rotation?”</p>
<p>“Tire replacement.”</p>
<p>I walked over and rubbed my nail in the tire’s crease. “What’s wrong with these?”</p>
<p>“If a man can afford new tires, why not?”</p>
<p>“Fair enough.” I grabbed the wrench she set down and walked to the tire on the opposite side.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, I can finish it on my own.”</p>
<p>I smiled and continued dizzying the wrench, as my mom would say.</p>
<p>“Seriously,” she said, “go enjoy your break.”</p>
<p>“Well, I figured I’d spend my break with you, since eating alone is kind of lame and the other guys are a little too old for me.” In reality, I wanted to get to know her–her who I’d be working next to for the rest of the summer. Her who was my best friend’s sibling that I hardly knew and actually had an excuse to get to know without it being awkward. Questions ran through my mind. How alike were the two? How much did she know about me? Was George different around her?</p>
<p>“I was just going to continue working,” she said, taking the tire off and rolling it to the side where she scuffled off the worn rubber. “Helps get my mind off of things and leaves less work to do later.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the American dream.” I took my tire off too and rolled it to where Jenny was working on hers. After she finished, I picked hers up and set it on the ground for her then put mine up where hers was. “Not a healthy way to live your life, you know.”</p>
<p>“Like I said, go enjoy your break. I can handle myself.” She rolled her tire around the car.</p>
<p>“And like I said, I want to spend my break with you.” The words sounded a little more flirtatious than I expected them to be coming out of my mouth. That wasn’t my intention. I wasn’t going to hit on George’s sister, and certainly not if I was going to be working with her.</p>
<p>She came back around to get the wrench where I left it leaning against the wall. I wasn’t as good at changing tires, but I tried to keep up with her nonetheless. After I finished my tire, I walked around and leaned against the car, waiting for her to finish taking the lugnuts off the next one off. “Jenny, it’s going to be a long semester. I’m not going to let you keep pushing yourself like this for no reason.”</p>
<p>She stood up and popped the tire off, nearly smashing my toes while leaving the wrench on the ground. “Or what? You’re going to stop me?”</p>
<p>“Well, if you don’t take a break, I’m just going to help you through all these small tasks until there’s nothing left to do, then yes, you’ll be forced to take a break.” </p>
<p>I picked up the wrench and went to swap my tires as she worked on hers. We worked the remainder in silence. I wasn’t getting through to her once more and it began driving me insane. No matter how hard I tried, she remained distant. Every time we met eyes, I would smile and she would look away or brush her face. Every time I joked, she nodded. And when we worked side by side as we did now, no matter how quickly I worked, she was faster. Absurdly faster. Like an entire pit crew collapsed into a single individual that raced to leave my presence. </p>
<p>By the time I finished, she was already inside with the customer. I hung up the wrench, lowered the car, and headed inside past a row of white, gray, and black cars lifted at varying heights. Daniel was still tinkering with a gray one. I think I heard he liked to finish before going on break, so he’d just push lunch back and focus on what was at hand.</p>
<p>Through the glass door, I saw Jenny leading the lady back out to her car and held the door open for them.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” the lady said.</p>
<p>“My pleasure.”</p>
<p>The door swung shut behind me as I entered the air conditioned room. No one else was in the lobby waiting on their vehicle. I checked the list of the remaining cars on the clipboard and they were all already taken by the others, unfinished by the time lunch hit. It looks like Jenny was out of luck. I washed my hands in the bathroom then grabbed my brown-bagged lunch and followed out after her.</p>
<p>Outside, the car pulled away and Jenny was left standing in the empty space. I walked up behind her and as she turned around, I handed her an Oreo. “If we’re going to be working together,” I said, “I would at least like to get to know you.”</p>
<p>“Would you just leave me alone?” she hissed out of nowhere. “Why can’t you get the hint?”</p>
<p>And there’s the phrase of a woman that us guys have no idea how to respond to, because we have no idea what we did to deserve such an outburst. I helped her change tires and then offered her an oreo, why was she pissed?</p>
<p>I shook my head and walked away. What else was there to say? I didn’t know.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>I was about half way through my sandwich, sitting with my back against the front of the garage watching cars pass by, when Jenny appeared in my peripherals. Her elbow was cupped in her hand and her eyes looked to the ground</p>
<p>“Sorry about the outburst earlier,” she said. “There’s just a lot going on in my head.”</p>
<p>“No, don’t be sorry. I get it.” No I didn’t. Well, I did more than before, but no. I also wasn’t sure if she actually wanted to join me for lunch or if she was simply apologizing for yelling, so I just sat there as she stood over me, not saying anything because I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p>Finally she sat down next to me, leaning her back against the wall that supported mine, and propped her arms on her knees mirrored like me. “I guess you were right. There’s no more cars left, so I have no choice but to take a break.”</p>
<p>“It’s nice, isn’t it? No immediate responsibilities left, so you can just enjoy the sunshine without stress.”</p>
<p>“Well, the point of working was to take my mind off the stress.”</p>
<p>Stress? Was she still stressed about trying to fit into the environment of the shop? I thought she had been doing just fine. I didn’t ask though. She seemed like she wanted to rant and talk through her problems, so I continued to bite at my sandwich. I was just happy to be getting through to her.</p>
<p>“It sucks,” she said, “not knowing if your mom is going to survive or not. If these are going to be her last days. And I’m stuck without any way to change that. No matter what I do. The worst part is, none of it feels real, like my mom isn’t in danger and she’ll be back home soon. We knew this day would come. But none of us believed it would.”</p>
<p>I knew Mrs. Lebedeva almost my entire life. Was it weird that it caused me more sorrow seeing George and Jenny distraught than knowing Mrs. Lebedeva might soon die? Maybe it didn’t feel real to me either. </p>
<p>Then again, Jenny described her feeling towards the situation as stress. Not anxiety, not worry, not fear. Stress. As though she believed there was some demanding part in it that was up to her that she was failing at.</p>
<p>“It’s like I almost don’t care,” she continued. “I know it sounds cruel, but I don’t know a world where people close to me die. It doesn’t seem possible. Life can’t be that fragile.”</p>
<p>“I understand quite well, actually.” That much I knew to be true. Knowing death was almost a bragging right at school. Being able to slap that on your instagram bio… Not many people had some story or trademark to tag onto it, but as long as their Bacon number was less than seven, ‘fly high’ would be there. Other than that, the only mention of death was in history class where week after week we learned about how tens of millions of people died from some event every couple of decades. Did they really expect us to comprehend that? Or was it some sick joke to ‘exercise our mind’ with memorizing that shit?</p>
<p>Still, if she wasn’t stressed about work or her mother, then what about the situation was she stressed about? I’d find out one day. But for today, I rubbed her shoulder and set the last Oreo I was saving for her in her hand hanging off of her knee. “We’ll get through this.”</p>
<p>She turned her head to me and smiled. Finally. “I don’t really have a choice, do I?”</p>
<p>“You do. You could choose to give up, curse God, never leave the house, and become an alcoholic to numb the pain, but you’re not. You’re working to help pay for the surgery, talking through your problems, and facing the world head on. I respect that.”</p>
<p>The shop started to come back to life behind us. Dad was digging through drawers asking Bobby where a tool was while Bobby was headfirst under the hood. In front of us, a car turned off the road and parked by the lobby. It was time to get back to work.</p>
