								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Four</h1><br>
<p>There was a question: could an all powerful god create a rock so large that even they could not move it? I called such a god weak, because if that god could not do so, then what was I? For there was a dominating cliff who only existed because I willed it so, who silenced a roaring sea and set a monstrous sun merely to call my name, who entertained a trodden path of triumph and sorrow that I raced along in the early October evening.</p>
<p>The path led to the cliff’s end, through undergrowth that masked cresting waves between long blades of grass. Wolves often lurked behind the trees and scars of trenches lined the peak. However, all was quiet that day, until I heard a child’s voice cry from beneath the ledge in between waves that swallowed it whole. His fingers clenched the earth. Death’s grip tightened around his ankles. His fate spanned seconds—seconds saved had I not faltered my pace by a dozen steps over the course of ten thousand. My heart shouted faster! Though determination alone could not quicken my sprint. I strove helplessly as a final wave brewed in the distance. The child screamed. It rose above the land, tumbled toward the cliff, and as I was steps from the ledge, the wave crashed against the rock and the child disappeared in its wake.</p>
<p>My watch buzzed. Time was up. Two seconds too slow. I halted at the foot of my driveway and fell to my knees, crunching bits of gravel gathered by years of rain, wind, and worn soles. I had failed. I lost. Each gasp of air was a lovely sting to my broken heart, small wisps of air from butterfly wings collectively stirring a hurricane. What should have been a story to quench my thirst was another dreadful tale, and somewhere clandestinely in-between was the happiest of souls to have experienced it.</p>
<p>My mom shouted my name, her voice like a morning alarm. I stuffed the story into my memory for later and looked to the porch. She leaned against the railing, and to the side of her sat Lucas with a folded newspaper in one hand and iced tea in the other, talking to her as casually as one could sweaty, breathless, and shirtless. Upon my catching his stare, Lucas snapped the newspaper open as though he were attentively buried in it awaiting my arrival. His whole show was a mockery of mine, for not only did he pull me from my dream, but he invalidated it entirely having been there when the child still danced atop the cliff. He made my story only of my insignificance and mediocrity.</p>
<p>I could not escape that reality no matter how fast I ran. The older I inevitably became, the more the world grew. It was Lucas and George who challenged me in the early years, and before I could catch up in the later ones, I found myself competing against all of those who also strove to go to Valencia, all of whom also grew to be much better than me while I remained stagnant. Somewhere, I fell behind.</p>
<p>I think it started with Lucas. He was not always faster than me. In fact, he used to say no one else was faster than him until we met at high school track tryouts. What a story that was! Over the years, he closed the distance, and then widened it in his favor. While I became old and fat, he rose to my place atop the podium. Gold medal in hand, running became an integral aspect of his life, as much as a morning coffee is to those who find no other motivation to get out of bed. What difference there was between it and succumbing to other human instincts Lucas so often criticized wasn’t one he could establish beyond the mental accomplishment. And even then, the dopamine rush was not disparate to any other dopamine rush. But he would still imbue it with visceral music and embrace a state of mind that brought out the emancipating dreams we all dream, to experience them with the pains and joys of it together. It was his journey in life that no one else could comprehend, its ups and downs a part of a story separate from reality; in that, no one cared, because no one truly appreciated embracing an aspect of life such as that. People with the gift of a human mind, antithetically devoid of the discipline or desire for dramatizing struggles in life beyond what they had yet to overcome.</p>
<p>That much we had in common. I might even say he learned it from me. But what did Lucas actually want? Was he content with simply daydreaming? Because he didn’t hold the same interest in George that I did. Granted, George and I had been friends long before we met Lucas, but I meant it in what George represented—the manifestation of those dreams. One might ask the same question of me because I had never successfully pursued a dream either. Did I even want a real dream then?</p>
<p>Mom yelled once more asking if I was alright. Lucas discreetly peered over the paper. I rose to my feet and hobbled up the driveway.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until Mom welcomed me home that Lucas lowered the paper and said, “oh, about time.”</p>
<p>I leaned my arms against the post, slowing my panting. “You have a very poor sense of humor.”</p>
<p>Mom slapped my arm. "That’s no way to treat your friend.”</p>
<p>I glanced at Lucas who raised his eyebrows and pulled back up the paper. I hoped whoever wanted to read it had done so as sweat trickled from Lucas’s hair onto the pages.</p>
<p>"He wasn’t an easy kid to raise,” Mom said, turning back to Lucas to repeat yet another story from my childhood, knowing she had already told it but loved Lucas’s laugh. No one else cared for the stories that entrenched her for years. “He was scared of any doctor, dentist, or anything that came with an appointment not because he was scared of the procedure but because the wait times were long and always behind schedule. And he would complain and complain until he got home, and then complain about everything else. Dinner was horrible, showers were a waste of time, bedtime was too early.” Lucas returned all the pleasantry gestures as the story carried on, nodding and shaking his head in beat with her tone. “It has gradually built into a perpetual state of grumpiness, always letting the bad things ruin the good things. Always griping about any minor inconvenience—”</p>
<p>“I’m honest,” I said.</p>
<p>“Honest to a fault. No one wants to have minds read to them. Especially not at your age.”</p>
<p>“I know where I get it from now.”</p>
<p>Lucas was peering above the newspaper, as though he were preparing to repeat his childish joke. I looked over my shoulder expecting George to be in the driveway, but he wasn’t there. I looked further down the street, and he wasn’t there either. Where was he? </p>
<p>Lucas made it seem like it was with impatience, but it was with worry that he slammed the newspaper onto the table. “Where’s George?” he asked. “Wasn’t he with you?”</p>
<p>“I went ahead of him at the bridge.”</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t have left him behind,” Lucas said, jumping from his chair and hopping down the stairs. I followed behind him.</p>
<p>When we jogged around the nearest corner, we caught sight of George running not far down the street, less than a half mile from the house. We closed the distance and then ran alongside him. He looked pitiful. I moped about my own slow down while he was a league behind me. What happened?</p>
<p>“Push yourself!” Lucas yelled. “This is what life is about. Pushing through the pain when all has gone to hell and still coming out on top. You sprint to the fucking end of it!”</p>
<p>George grunted and broke into the sprint.</p>
<p>George said the day I outran him on our route would be the day I could talk to Jenny. I never could tell if he was joking; I once had a crush on Jenny years ago and he and Lucas never let it go. He offered it again that day, and I agreed. Mostly for fun, but I was also worried Jenny got the wrong impression from work, and that George beating me was his polite way of letting me know. I didn’t feel bad leaving him in the dust because he was supposed to swing around in the final stretch, because it was his normal time that I raced against. His slowdown was truly a sight to behold. It had never happened before.</p>
<p>His stumbling down the road was close to my heart. He didn’t slow down as a tease. His bet was not about Jenny. He wanted to beat me for his own sake, to prove to himself that he hadn’t fallen behind like I had, but his stride was short and his sprint was pathetic.</p>
<p>Lucas and I kept his old pace so as to not embarrass him further, and we looked at each other as opposites. Lucas regretted pushing George along. He thought what he did was cruel. I didn’t. If George was amidst a battle, the moment he stopped fighting would his life of dreams be forfeit. I couldn’t let him do that yet.</p>
<p>We arrived with George collapsed on my front lawn. He shaded his eyes from the sun with his forearm and squinted at us, his bare chest expanding and collapsing as deeply as it could. “About time…,” he said between breaths, “what took… you guys… so long?”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask you the same,” Lucas replied.</p>
<p>“Oh, you know… saw a cat… and tried to… chase after it.” George turned to his knees and crawled to the outdoor water socket poking from the wall of the house near the garden. He twisted its squeaky handle and let the water pour upon him. He wasn’t tired. He was exhausted.</p>
<p>“Did you eat anything today?” I asked, “Or did you run eight miles on an empty stomach?”</p>
<p>George gulped the water collecting in his cupped hands, then sat and let the water splash against his back. He savored the heavenly sensation in silence. It was a common trait in the Lebedev family apparently, to get lost in the moment and ignore ol’ mosquito Mickey.</p>
<p>After he recovered his breathing, he said, "Mom got transferred last night. Her procedure is in two weeks, so Jenny and I were up with her all night beforehand, saying our goodbyes. Just in case, you know.”</p>
<p>Lucas sat down beside him in the puddled grass. "Shit, man, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>George cracked a smile. "The doctor said he had high hopes. He said he wouldn't say that if he didn't believe it."</p>
<p>"You said two weeks?" Lucas asked.</p>
<p>"Something like that. They have to do screenings and monitoring." George stood and stopped the water. He was no more wet than when he was drenched in sweat. The way the drops rolled between his abs showed that he was losing weight.</p>
<p>"You should really be there with her," I said, grabbing his shoulder.</p>
<p>"The plane tickets and hotel fees are too expensive, and I need to work."</p>
<p>"Hell,” Lucas said, still sitting in the puddle, “I'll cover the tickets and hotel myself."</p>
<p>George shook his head. "I can't wait for you to run back and encourage me every time things get hard. That's not going to help me move on if things don't go well and it's not going to leave a good taste in my mouth otherwise."</p>
<p>The whole family was stubborn, of course. George, his sister, and his father. Even his mother was too stubborn to die.</p>
<p>"If you care about it that much,” Lucas pleaded, “say you'll pay me back. With interest."</p>
<p>We all knew Lucas wouldn't take the repayment anymore than George would accept the offer. George ignored him.</p>
<p>"Fuck dude, let us help you."</p>
<p>"I am. I promise.”</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>There was a windowsill in my room that overlooked the street and stared down into the city from its peak in the hills. </p>
<p>As a kid, I was paranoid about the city returning my stare. I thought everyone could see me sitting in the windowsill, or at my desk or on my bed, so I hid behind thick curtains that never parted. Then one morning, after a long night of peaking at the city from a small opening, I returned to school studying everyone's eyes when we were outside. </p>
<p>I learned that no one looks up. They look down at their feet when they walk, looked down at the ground when they talk, and glanced, rather, down at their phones when permitted like an instinct at the slightest hint of awkwardness. Those most watched were not the ones at the top, but the ones at the bottom by the cascading rows of eyes. Once I learned that, I comfortably stretched out in the alcove continuing to cast my judgement upon the city like a deistic god.</p>
<p>Newport was a beautiful city. In the night, its lights created a foggy bubble tinted gray-blue by the moon. A cluster of towers centered the city near the shore, and to its side, a wide, windy river. A large Ferris wheel was a white web of lights on the outskirts of the towers, marking a home of memories for everyone who lived in the city. The Grand Plaza it was called. And to the side of that, a little further outside the city, was Valencia, where a lone bell tower peaked from above the trees.</p>
<p>I rarely spent a night without staring at my application, spilling soft lies in-between lines, reciting it aloud from my window, and starting anew. Yet, if the best of my drafts was a poem, I was an instrumental-less bard whose sole purpose was to lull the city to sleep from my window. It was routine then, that in my constant lust for dreams, sitting idly and uninspired by my own life, my mind easily wandered off.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I leapt into the trembling sea, after the waves that retreated with their prey. The water choked me with its freezing, wet hands whose long nails dug into my skin. It flailed my body about with the strength of its great current. As my fall eased under the water, I looked about and found the child flailing in the open chasm. I wrapped an arm around their chest and surfaced, then backstroked toward the cliff in a swinging cradle of sea water that made my mouth taste of salt.</p>
<p>I braced as a wave slammed us against the rock. My elbow ached with pain. The cliff face offered no hold to grasp. It was too flat and wet to climb. Our only choice was to swim alongside it hoping to find a bed of rocks where the land dipped low enough to climb onto.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>A passing car honked its horn, and the subsequent car apropos to it swept my room with bright lights. Their engines hummed into opposing distances.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I swam backward with the child hoisted against my chest in a periodic cycle of waves, bracing when they slammed us into the rock and gasping for breath when they pulled away. Eventually, my back hit a smooth surface beneath the water. I climbed onto it, up above the water, and pulled the child with me to the surface. We crawled over the series of rocks, hands held together tight so as to anchor the child from being swept away once more, until we found our footing in sand and gravel that we traveled up and far, far away behind the tree line so that we did not fear another drop of chilling water reaching our skin. We never let go of hands, not after we sat in the undergrowth.</p>
<p>When I looked to the child, I found it to be a girl, contra to the boy I imagined dancing atop the cliff.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I picked up my phone and scrolled down my contact list and tapped on Jenny. A short history of texts popped up with timestamps of a couple of years ago, an exchange that fit on one screen. The texts were between me and George when he left his phone at home during a track meet. It was the only reason I had her number.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Hope you’re doing okay</i>.</p>
<p>I set the phone beneath my curled legs and continued staring out the window. A couple of minutes later, my phone vibrated on the wooden ledge of the alcove with a text from Jenny:</p>
<p><i>Did George not pick up the phone? </i></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><i>Why would I be trying to reach George at 1 in the morning? </i></p>
<p><i>Why would you be trying to reach me at 1 in the morning? </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>Look, I’m just trying to be nice. </i></p>
<p><i>I’m fine. Thanks for asking. </i></p>
<p>I was expecting such a response. Still, my hand clenched around the words.</p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>You’ve been so rude to me all day, while so kind to everyone else.  Have I done something wrong? </i></p>
<p>I tossed my phone, clunking it onto the wooden ledge. The window fogged from my deep sigh. The condensation refracted the thousand lights of the city into a kaleidoscope. There was no more river or sea, no more office buildings or Ferris wheel or bell tower, yet my dreams nestled deeper into the city ever so slightly more, for behind the remanence of my breath was an abstraction of the specificities, so that I could imagine the world behind it for myself.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The shoreline was coated in a rushing mist. The trees croaked deeply from the wind that had stirred the waves so tremendously. I could make out the child next to me, but no further would my eyesight reach. She clasped her hand around mine and led me into the trees, navigating as though she lived nearby. Soon we reached my trodden path and traced it back. Somewhere along it—I couldn’t say where, despite having memorized the entirety of it—a second path merged into ours. The path wasn’t a hardened dirt path one would expect, yet the undergrowth parted as though it were. The further we traveled back along my path, the more of these strange partings appeared. Numerous untaken paths that each led to their own adventures. Then, she turned down one of the paths, and led me to a story that might have been much kinder.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>My phone vibrated against the wood. Its screen lit the alcove, blocking the view out the window with a shallow reflection of myself. I sat up to fetch it and squinted at the bright screen.</p>
<p><i>I’m sorry. I get that you’re trying to be nice, and I appreciate it. We’ve known this day would come for years. We’re all holding up better than you think. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>I don’t believe you, but even then, why were you acting like you were? What was bothering you? </i></p>
<p><i>Why do you care so much? </i></p>
<p>Glancing at her picture in the bubble next to her name, I thought it once and I thought it again: she was the most peculiar person I had ever stumbled upon, for her mask was of stone, a face that had looked at Medusa! And I was a perplexed wanderer who had never heard of the myth. What had she seen? She was a girl in a painting on the wall that seemed to stare at her observer, when all she truly saw was what the observer could guess was past the easel. Her lips were slightly parted, and her mute brows were crafted by the most delicate of strokes such that her emotion could not be discerned between content and awe and disappointment.</p>
<p>She had everything I dreamed of. She had the story and path in life I longed for. What was it like? </p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>Because you are a mystery to me. </i></p>
<p><i>You really are weird. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>I’m honest. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>Tell me, why is it that when you could easily pin your troubles on your family tragedy, you don’t? </i></p>
<p><i>More about your application? </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>What? What makes you think that? </i></p>
<p><i>I don’t know. </i> </p>
<p><i>Every time I think about what’s going on, I think back to that day when you were reading out loud your essay, right before everything went to shit again. </i> </p>
<p><i>Your essays were always asking dumb questions, like “what does it take to shift one’s perspective of the world?” </i></p>
<p>Had I actually wrote that? I reached for the notebook by my feet and flipped through its pages. Several drafts back, the question was indeed there, without any relevance to the degree I was applying for. I hated reading it and tossed it away.</p>
<p style=”display: block; text-align: right;float: right;”><i>That draft was profoundly awful. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i style=”display: block; text-align: right;”>I understand why you wish I’d shut up now. My apologies. </i></p>
<p><i>It wasn’t bad. </i></p>
<p style=”display: block; text-align: right; width: 100%;”><i>You did say they were dumb. </i></p>
<p><i>They were dumb. </i></p>
<p><i>I couldn’t answer them though. </i></p>
<p><i>And isn’t that the point of pursuing an education? So that we can find an answer? That’s why I thought they fit. </i></p>
<p><i>I’ve been forced to confront them myself recently. Today I needed time to deal with them. I wanted space and you didn’t give that to me. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>I’m sorry. </i></p>
<p><i>I’m not mad at you. But next time, please understand. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>I will. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>I didn’t realize you dealt with the same questions. </i></p>
<p><i>Everyone does. </i></p>
<p><i>I think for me, you happened to ask them at the time they were meant to be asked. </i></p>
<p>Who else could say such a thing? None but her! Oh, what was it like?</p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>Did you find an answer? </i></p>
<p><i>If I did, I wouldn’t still be up. </i></p>
<p><i>I don’t even know where to begin. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>With the smaller ones of course. </i></p>
<p><i>The smaller ones? </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>Yeah. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>The smaller questions. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>For example, how did you get a job at the shop? </i></p>
<p><i>How is that related at all? </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>It’s one of my questions, is it not? </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>My questions are never relevant. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>And I’m currently much more curious about this question than any of the others. </i></p>
<p><i>I’m tempted to not answer. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>How about this…</i></p>
<p>I sent her the start of a tic-tac-toe game with an X in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>If I win, you answer the question. </i></p>
<p>She sent back an O in the opposite corner. </p>
<p>I returned with an X in the top left.  Shortly after, she began typing.</p>
<p><i>I took my car there a week ago and got swept up in small talk with your dad about everything. He talked to Mr. Martin and offered me the job. </i></p>
<p>Then Jenny put an O on the left middle square. </p>
<p>I placed the X in the bottom right spot to finish the trap with no accompanying text.</p>
<p><i>I really like your dad. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>I do too. </i></p>
<p>She sent an O in the middle, and I struck the finishing blow in the bottom middle. I liked that she had finished the game. Most people quit.</p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>I have another question: how does a car enthusiast not know how to drive a manual? </i></p>
<p><i>I don’t really care for cars actually. Mine just forced me to learn about them. </i></p>
<p>She sent me a game for eight-ball pool. </p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>Then what do you care for? </i></p>
<p><i>No more questions. You have to win first. Your rules. </i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, pool was something I didn’t really care for, but I really wanted to ask Jenny more questions. So, like any other clueless player, I aimed for daring shots with the aid of the dotted line and struck the cue ball with full power thinking that a new angle would be found no matter where it landed. Instead, I only lined up shots for Jenny who was much better than me, and before I got through half of the striped billiards, she sunk the black one.</p>
<p><i>Did you lose on purpose? </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>I wish. </i></p>
<p>I sent her a game of Four In A Row.</p>
<p><i>Hey! That does NOT count as a question. </i></p>
<p>My heart fluttered. I thought she didn’t take interest in me. I thought I was a pest. And I was so focused on questioning her that I didn’t think she’d want to play along!</p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>Ask away. </i></p>
<p><i>Do you actually like cars? You seemed distracted today. </i></p>
<p style=”text-align: right;”><i>Not really, but it’s the only thing I’m okay at other than running. </i></p>
<p>And who cared? The unfinished pages of my application were still sprawled out on my feet, completely forgotten.</p>
<p>After almost a full board, I got four in a row. Jenny sent her reply. </i></p>
<p><i>Cirrus clouds and cherries. </i></p>
<p>Then she started another god-forsaken game of eight-ball.</p>
<p>The games and exchange of questions between victors continued for some time: How did she end up working at that café of all cafés? Why did I care so much about Valencia? Did she feel out of place at the shop? Did I feel out of place at the shop? Why didn’t I talk to her before?</p>
<p>When the clock struck two, Jenny sent a picture of herself with a peace sign lit by the screen of her phone, the light reflecting off the window she leaned against. I liked the mysterious Jenny, but I was also happy to see her smile. I had not seen her genuinely smile before. Not like that. It wasn’t an ear-to-ear grin. It was a slight one that couldn’t be helped expressing itself.</p>
<p><i>See you tomorrow.</i></p>
