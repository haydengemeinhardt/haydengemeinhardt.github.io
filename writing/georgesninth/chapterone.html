<p>“I’m horrendously jealous of him.”</p>
<p>“He’s quite the persona,” Lucas said, lassoing his backpack over the neck of the chair, “but I don’t understand. There’s not a lot to him to be horrendously jealous about.”</p>
<p>“He got his life story before the deadline. Bad thing turned miracle, and now he knows his life story. Why he wants to do the things he wants to do. It’s not enough that he wants to. He knows he wants to.”</p>
<p>There is a world in which life never emerged. Or, rather, there is a world where life emerged and we are in it, but in the others where life never emerged and we were no more than rocks scattered around a barren satellite, I was a pebble tossed about in the current of a river, smooth and flat and round, the kind you’d come across and catch the uncontrollable urge to skip it across the lake it washed up at. He was crushed between two tectonic plates, burned in the belly of the Earth, thrust into the atmosphere over an ashen ancient city, pierced by the pick of a funny sounding archaeologist from a northern island, then settled amidst the dusty collection of a random rock-enthusiast in small-town America.</p>
<p>Well, Newport wasn't quite a small town, but it was suburban enough to look like the rest of the capitalist expanse we call America. Where everyone and everywhere was the same. Without character and without story. Much like me.</p>
<p>I slumped into the chair across from Lucas, the sun warming my skin through the window of the chilly Cafe Du Mont. It was the world’s worst cafe: loud, busy, and an ill-assorted collection of art. The floor was sticky with unscrubbable spills so every step sounded like squeaky tennis shoes against linoleum. The tables were small and wobbly and the chairs had a deafening creak even under a child’s weight. Even the lights were too bright.</p>
<p>But they had one dollar coffee.</p>
<p>“Maybe.” Lucas said, and I wasn’t paying attention enough to my own words to remember what that ‘maybe’ might have referred to. “But miracles don’t regularly happen, and I wouldn’t be jealous in that case.”</p>
<p>A piercing order came from the counter. A girl who clearly just came from school like us vehemently shouted as though she read the listings one-by-one off the pumps. “1 pump caramel syrup, 1 pump hazelnut syrup, 1 pump toffee nut syrup, 1 pump peppermint syrup, 1 pump raspberry syrup…” God forbid she had been any quieter, might miss a syrup pump. As she sauntered over to the pick up area, I could make out her face. Of course it was Emily. How she managed to memorize that order was beyond me because she regularly helped with the curve in history class.</p>
<p>Apparently my mind had an unwavering ability to lose focus today. I wasn’t feeling right.</p>
<p>I turned back to Lucas. “You don’t ever think ‘well, nothing good has happened to me, so maybe I want something bad to happen to me. Maybe even a sad life is one worth living more than the nothingness of my own. And maybe something good will happen after that’?”</p>
<p>“Sounds masochistic.”</p>
<p>“We’re runners, Lucas. We’re first and foremost masochists.”</p>
<p>“Still…”</p>
<p>“Don’t give me that bullshit. Everyone has those ideations. Especially you. I know how you run. Stories are what make us human and a desire for them is only natural.”</p>
<p>That’s what they said anyway and the lack thereof didn’t mean our chances of getting a story increased as time went on. It was the divide in life’s path between a star or a bum: those who held telling, beautiful lives rich in stories, and those like Lucas and I who struggled to conjure up even a half-exaggerated, half-bullshit story of their life, because all they really had done was the same as everyone else. And everyone else was bored or depressed.</p>
<p>I looked back to Emily who stood idly scrolling through her phone while waiting on her flavored sap. What was her life story? I wondered. And how could she be so much more content with life than I?</p>
<p>Maybe because she was joking with her friend while getting ready to enjoy her favorite afternoon drink and I was here being a dick about her order instead of doing the same. I was so in my head that I couldn’t just enjoy my time with Lucas under bright lights and sticky floors.</p>
<p>Margaret popped out from behind the counter and greeted us with a smile. Her shoes squelched on the sticky tile. Her stride fastened her apron against her body by the breeze. She carried a spray bottle and rag to disguise our chat as her cleaning the table for us, even though it was already cleaned as it always was before we got here, sweet as she was. Her smile then dropped to a frown and I quickly realized she wasn’t coming for a chat.</p>
<p>“Where’s George?” she questioned, spraying the table and slapping the rag on it.</p>
<p>What she really meant was ‘where’s Jenny?’ as Jenny was Margaret’s relief at three o’clock, and it was two fifty-five, and George was Jenny’s ride, and Margaret couldn’t take much more.</p>
<p>“He probably rear-ended someone,” Lucas joked, leaning back into his creaky chair.</p>
<p>“They’ll be here,” I said. “If not, we’ll take over the counter until then.”</p>
<p>Lucas shot me a glare. “Who’s we?”</p>
<p>Margaret put her hands to her hips. “Do you two idiots even know how to work a cash register?”</p>
<p>The answer was no. Lucas and I hadn’t worked a day in our life because our parents were wealthy enough to subvert any need for that. Granted, we were only rising seniors in high school, but we were acutely aware of our situation.</p>
<p>Much to Margaret’s relief, the door chimed with the entrance of Jenny and George. Jenny held the door open for George as he carried a small kitten in his arms. Not that he owned a kitten, but in the five minutes between school and here, he couldn’t resist finding something in the world to make a story out of. </p>
<p>The room perked in his direction as he walked over to our table.</p>
<p>“Sorry, we got a little preoccupied,” George said, cradling the kitten. “Guys, meet Joey. Joey, meet the guys.”</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just Lucas and I he was introducing Joey to. A couple of people from neighboring tables came to peek a look. They made little ‘aww’s and George told them all about Joey like he and Joey were longtime friends.</p>
<p>“He really likes chicken and sleeping, and scratches behind the ears.”</p>
<p>This was who George was. Living his best life, happy as can be snuggling that random kitten, just being himself with a smile stretched across his face as more people from the cafe swarmed around him. </p>
<p>They say life is only fun if you’re wealthy, smart, and good looking. I was wealthier than George, and was arguably smarter and better looking than George (with an apparent supplement of subjective narcissism), but George led the better life. He didn’t care about that shit, and no one else cared about it either. They were swarming him, not me, because he was living his life.</p>
<p>What was there not to be jealous about?</p>
<p>As people came and went to meet George and Joey, Jenny went to get our usual drinks and Lucas pulled out his notebook. To us, this was just another day around George. Actors in his Truman show. And I was perfectly happy with being an actor in his show. I loved the man. But sometimes I think, why didn’t I do that? Why didn’t I hop on the table and sing? Why didn’t I sign up as a volunteer in Kenya? Why didn’t I learn to play the guitar to join a band or learn a language? Why didn’t I get a job at the world’s worst cafe?</p>
<p></p>
<p>When Jenny returned, the room had settled back down to what one would expect a Cafe Du Mont to be. Still the world’s worst cafe, a cacophonous mess, but not quite so bad. Like kicking dirty clothes in a messy room back under the bed. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We all kicked back with our after-school beverages: George and I with our black coffees, Jenny with her vanilla latte, and Lucas with his shot of expresso. We were inveterate three-p.m. caffeine addicts, as pure caffeine was an appurtenance of our lifestyle as stressed high school and soon-to-be stressed college students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We needed it today, too. We had to answer that god-forbidden question. That question I mentioned earlier that separate the two kinds of people in life. The one that George had transcribed for him, that lucky bastard. It was one of those questions that I just did not know the answer to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I got a good one for you guys today," Lucas said. “Jenny you got a minute? I want your opinion too.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jenny wasn’t really part of our group. It was just Lucas, George, and I, and Jenny was only here because she worked here. But sometimes we would swing our drafts by her or ask her opinion about random things that came up in our conversation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Let’s hear it,” she said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lucas pushed back his chair as he stood, cleared his throat, then sonorously quoted with one hand wrapped around the helical coil of the folded notebook and the other animating the air as an assertive orator, “You ask a man on the verge of death how he’d go about consecrating his final day, and you’ll receive nothing short of drugs, sex, and gluttony, and perhaps if he’s a conventional fellow he’ll say one last good bye to his family. Surely there’s a greater thrill in life than that to pursue?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I put my hand to my face. The whole cafe could’ve heard us if they so pleased. He continued on but I couldn’t listen. If this is the best we had, how hopeless we were.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Doesn’t sound like too bad of a day,” George interrupted as he reached for the notebook. Lucas indiffidently handed it over with an optimistic flick of the wrist, certain he had finally nailed the introduction. George promptly tore the page in a fistful and, with the same confident flick of the wrist, chucked it into a nearby trash can. "A conventional fellow?" He chuckled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jenny snagged the notebook from George and smacked him upside the head with it, then tossed it back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lucas stretched his arms out to catch it, careful not to crease any pages. He was particularly fastidious regarding unnecessary imperfections, growing up as a messy kid with parents who didn’t take so kindly to his consistent picking. Yet, he was rather distracted for once with Jenny’s defense of him and eagerly asked, “So do you think my intro is okay?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>She bit her lip. “Well, you’re applying to pre-med. Shouldn’t you be saying something about, like, arteries or tissues?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It won’t be doctors reading my application, will it?” He sighed and turned to me for one final attempt at some kind of approval, but I sat with folded arms. “Oh come on, not you too Mickey.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It sounds like it’s… missing something.” I tried not to be as harsh as the others, but Lucas valued my opinion in such a way that any negative judgment would make him reconsider even the most certain of decisions. And I decided then that I wanted him to reconsider</p>
<p></p>
<p>“But there’s something to be said about it, right?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Only of how unoriginal it is.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You don’t even know where I was going with it.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Not to Duke.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>With those brusque words, Lucas flipped to a new page, forgetting that George had already done so for him, then continued to occasionally switch between biting the frayed rubber eraser of the pencil and the remains of his lunch, contriving the next disappointingly sententious opener. Lucas had been at it for weeks now and hadn’t even a rough draft to show for it. In fact, it only got worse as his panic settled in. Having generations of family follow the same path Lucas would not be able to keep on was nothing short of disheartening.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You’re just going to have to accept that you won’t be getting in,” Jenny said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>His face twitched. He set down the notebook book and continued twirling his pencil. “I have to at least try.” And so was the catch: a chance he would be able to prove to himself and everyone around him that he had worth.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Why don’t you write your story like we’ve been telling you?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I don’t have any story different from every other privileged white kid in our school,” Lucas said, slapping his hands against the table.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This was who Lucas was. He had had everything he had thought he wanted short of a private yacht, and even then he hadn’t the desire for one if the opportunity shone itself, as he had no care for the ocean. Everything about his life was so satiated it became dull, and in the dullness no desire to strive further shone itself; that if being dissatisfied with life was a necessity to being satisfied with life, he was neither. And that’s what we were: two dull guys who met on the track, without a story, a motivation, or a purpose in life, pulling each other along day by day, in all practicalities living to prove ourselves to each other rather than any person, any god, or any culture, but yet with the same anxiety one would have with all of those at once.</p>
<p></p>
<p>George feigned a palpable tsk. “Lucas, I love you and everyone else at this school, but just because you were born with an advantage doesn’t mean there’s any extra expectation of you in life.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yet the desire claws at me, and I can’t lie to myself about something so prominent in my mind.” </p>
<p></p>
<p>“And I’m sure the desire to fuck someone and smoke a cigarette with them afterward would claw at you too if you’d give it a try.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I don’t want to live a boring life. I want to be…”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yet here you are,” George shouted, knocking us back, “living your life by scribbling in a notebook so that someday you can live your life. But guess what? That day will never come, because you will be in an endless loop of spending your life trying to get to the next step where you think you’ll then actually live your life. It’s not even entirely your fault, but come on Lucas…” George’s words were cut short by a ring from his phone. “Mom” he said and excused himself to take it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hmm, that might actually be a good one.” Lucas said, trying not to show the strike with which George’s words had hit him. Only at Jenny and I’s collective sigh did Lucas retract it with “Kidding” and slump back into his chair. “Oh, Mickey, how’s your essay going?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>I looked down at the pages of the notebook in front of me. It was full of words and phrases and quotes, some scratched out, others underlined. At least it wasn’t empty, but I didn’t know where I wanted to go with it. It was all baseline stuff with nothing behind it and nothing fitting together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’m not sure.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, let’s hear it,” Lucas said. “I read mine loud and proud, don’t let me down.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the moment I hesitated. The next, I wondered how I was legitimately supposed to wish I was George if I was too shy to even read aloud a rough draft of an essay with all the eager ears expecting a rough draft of an essay. So I cleared my throat, lifted my notebook, and read aloud, “When I ran as a child, I knew then that I liked to run. When I read as a child, I knew then that I liked to read. When I strummed the strings of a guitar as a child, I knew then that I liked to create music with my own hands. But when I…” </p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the shoulder of Lucas, I saw George walk back with his head down. When he lifted it, I saw that same look I had seen years ago, like a visible shadow had shaded his wide eyes from above.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Mom has cancer again.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The table fell silent. All emotion was wrung out like a strained cloth. Whatever page Lucas was writing on slowly fell on the table into a crease. Jenny’s mouth twitched, as though she was about to yell at George for playing a late and cruel April Fools joke, but even in the face of her denial, no actor in the world could masquerade the face that plagued George.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are certain phrases I do not know how to respond to. Those from parents, when the disappointment is so great that they take responsibility for your mistakes. “I should have never let you do that.” Those from girls that us guys just don’t get, where there is no correct response. “Would you still love me if I was a worm?”. Those from the police, which weren’t a problem at the time. “Why would you steal something so petty?”. Those from college applications. “Share your story”. </p>
<p>Then those from friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first had come when we were only thirteen. “Mom has cancer,” he had said. When a friend tells you that, you think carefully about what to say. I had stood frozen in that moment, cycling through a number of different sarcastic, optimistic, pitiful, sympathetic statements before I had decided there was nothing in that moment I could have said that could have made his heart feel better. Lucas and I had given a nod of agreement and just hugged him.</p>
<p></p>
<p>His mom had survived, but damn do I hate him for it. Sometimes I wish he had said, “Tomorrow I’m going to tell you my mom has cancer.” Sometimes I wish death would warn, “tomorrow I’m going to visit you.” Sometimes I wish even the weather would say “tomorrow I’m going to pour like hell” or my computer “tomorrow I’m going to retire”, but the former two would be the beginnings of great stories, for every great story begins with a great phrase.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not great in delight, but great in impression, influence, or impact. “I am a sick man… I am a spiteful man,'' Dostyesvsky wrote. “Ships at a distance have every man’s wish on board,” Hurston wrote. “Justice? You get justice in the next world, in this world you have law,” Gaddis wrote. But unlike Dostoyevsky or Hurston or Gaddis, and much unlike the last great story of George, this didn’t feel great.</p>
<p></p>
<p>His line was blunt. It had been done before, a story written, read, and told, yet we were to go through it once again.  It did nothing but reinforce my belief that stories stay with one throughout their life, lingering in the background, constantly giving life to the body it followed. It didn’t feel great to me because it wasn’t my story, so to me it sounded the same. Maybe Lucas was right. Maybe I wouldn’t want to be on the wrong side of a bad story. </p>
<p></p>
<p>But maybe to George, it sounded like music. A piece he had heard once before that tore him apart the day he heard it. How beautiful the piece must be, and how unfortunate I am to be unable to hear it.</p>
