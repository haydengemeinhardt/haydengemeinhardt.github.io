<p>Splashes of water and vomit spilled from Jenny’s pale blue lips into the shallow pool of water around us. I tilted her head to the side and continued compressions as the operator guided me over the phone. Jenny began hacking up pink phlegm, then puked onto the tile floor. Her body spasmed, and I stopped and watched harrowingly.</p>
<p>An officer barged in through the front door of the house. I called for them, and the officer rushed in and shoved me aside so she could take over. I waited uncomfortably outside the bathroom, looking down at the floor for I couldn’t bear to look anywhere else, and drowning out any sentence that didn’t pertain to me. If Jenny was conscious, I hoped she didn’t notice me. It wasn’t right for me to see her in such a compromised state, and it made me miserable, so I tried to strike it from my mind. But I couldn’t get her lifeless eyes out of my own, or her gurgling out of my ears, and my wet clothes clung to me like I was still holding onto her.</p>
<p>When fire arrived, the officer handed me my phone and moved me to the front yard. She assured me Jenny was likely going to be okay, then leashed me there like a stray dog to be dealt with later. But when she returned inside, I walked away. I couldn’t be there any longer. Jenny mattered too much to pretend like she didn’t, and the only purpose in me remaining there was to fill in paperwork—the same tranquilizing, nauseating routine I’d done before, and with it would come questions I did not want to answer: “how did you find her?” Megan would know. They could refer to her if they so pleased. The more important question was the one Jenny was going to have to ask herself when the time came: <i>if someone committed a disgraceful act against you, but unintentionally in doing so saved you, could you forgive them?</i></p>
<p>I sped home with my windows rolled down. On straight roads, the speed limit was null, and my car shook against the resistance of the wind. But when I arrived home, I paused and collected myself. There was no reason to be angry or upset, I told myself; Jenny was okay. I exited my car and entered my silent home. Dad was still at work. Flint was asleep on the couch. I creaked up the stairs into my room and changed out of my wet, saggy clothes, draping them over the frame of the shower so they could drip dry. </p>
<p>I sat down at my desk with the scene still fresh in mind and pulled out the old, desecrated notebook. I had a story—could I transcribe it? It was almost selfish, but what else was I to do? I wasn’t able to focus anyway. Even if I had a story, I couldn’t come to tell it. Instead, I stared long enough at the empty page, lost in a trance of thought and daydream, for the sun to droop toward the horizon and stretch the shadows outside, and as the wave of adrenaline wore off in the silent house, the existential questions returned to their place. Never had I been so genuinely uninterested in playing my luck at Valencia. The name itself tasted like stale bread. To tempt me with it then would be to tempt me with an old pair of shoes. </p>
<p>I was raised with the privilege of being so far removed from not meeting basic needs that relief from those needs was as much a fact of life as the needs themselves, and so the joy of meeting them was hardly a joy at all. But there were other needs—desires that clung to the fence between them and needs, and became needs themselves when my heart decided sitting safely on the other side was so boring and lifeless that I already felt dead. </p>
<p>I was far from death though. The Lebedevs had pointed out real death on the far yet nearing horizon from the ship’s birdnest, where the ocean spilled over the edge of the Earth. We could pull each other from the water when the waves grew too tall; we could not pull each other from a waterfall. The horizon was no longer infinite, but an immediate danger, and we had no means of turning the ship away from it. Nor did we even have the means to turn our minds away from needing to avoid it in the absence of our ability to do so. Once realized, it would never be unrealized. The ball and chain would forever remain, for <i>One is always prey to one’s truths. Once one has admitted them, one cannot free oneself from them.*</i> But to then cease pulling each other from the water because of it? What if I found myself barefoot on an island of shattered glass, as it felt standing in Jenny’s bathroom? Would I still be fixated on the horizon as the glass shards dug into my soles, or would I be longing for an old pair of shoes? Even wishing the horizon was closer, were no shoes found? Although the horizon was overbearing, the present could command my attention when facing me with a more immediate, more real death. In fact, it was <i>only</i> in solitude and comfort, as far from death as one could be, did the present graciously grant me a gaze at the horizon. What did that say about the gun in my back, when it too had a master?</p>
<p>In reality, I would never be in “solitude”; I would always be without an unmet need. That too was part of the human condition, no matter how much one tried to remove oneself from it—monk, priest, or nun. And truths that were realized from a perspective inevitably biased by needs were not so much as truths as they were, in their essence, perspectives tainted with bias. Just as hunger overcame thoughts, so did limitations of being overcome truth—if such a thing was attainable. For how much truth could be found in the words of one who says to not fear death, when they themselves were on death row? Was it not a coping mechanism? Or was it the most truthful they could possibly be to themselves, having been forced to finally confront it with no out? Was the most desperate form of myself the truest form of myself, or was it simply the most desperate form of myself, as the saddest form is the saddest and the happiest the happiest? It was indeed a form. A form of an insentient spirit after finding itself as it was, which was no more true of a form than that of a spirit exhilarated by the very same finding. </p>
<p>Whether there existed truth or not, the mystery of life and the inevitability of death still seemed to have a hold over me. I would still trip and stumble, unable to take my eyes off the horizon as it was too powerful of a sight. Ought I not to then at least look down occasionally to stop myself from tripping? For if I tripped, my eyes would surely be taken off anyway. And if I watched the horizon while eating, as I had to eat, could I enjoy what I ate? No one could proclaim stale bread and muddy water the equivalent of a fresh croissant and warm coffee, and if they did, they ought to substitute it for as long as they did. And when it would snow, could I put on a coat, or did I have to freeze so I wouldn’t need to look away? Would cozily sitting by a warm fire by any means take my attention and awe away from the horizon? It seemed I could at least try to enjoy the simplicities of life, to enjoy meeting my needs if I had to meet them anyway. Not that I had to, or even would, but that I could. How worthless that ability, that possibility once seemed! But just as pain was truer than suffering, so evidently was love, and the ability to act on those other needs and desires, on love and pain, was more valuable than anything I could imagine, as watching someone I loved be hurt by my own hands was worse than suffering.</p>
<p>Why must I have struck Jenny from my heart? The gun that pressed into my back was not the gun I thought it was, much like the new foundation wasn’t the foundation I thought it was. The gun didn’t command that I should be sad, but that I ought to be sad. That any happiness was a false happiness (was there any more egregious an oxymoron?), and my self-imposed sadness a correct sadness, and thus an inescapable sadness. It was the gun of an addiction that forced myself to look away and be dishonest with myself about what it was. That was the inescapable grasp, and the ingenuity of the abyss. It wasn’t if I was smart enough to catch on. It was that I suspended self-awareness, any hint of consciousness, and pretended I hadn’t caught on—and pretended I hadn’t caught on to pretending not to have caught on—so I could delay the guilt to fulfill the itch, the itch of reaffirming my suffering, “as it was meant to be”—most the guilt of which was ironically in all the pretending, but even that too was often pretended away while the pain of the guilt remained and was reimagined as part of the suffering.</p>
<p>It wasn’t my first conflict with addiction. Rather, it was part of the same addiction that was dictating my course of life through and through: an obsession with the great phenomena of life, and my ability, or lack thereof, to obtain or experience them. The only variable was the upper limit or magnitude of the qualities of greatness, which continuously rose the more I contemplated, confronted, and chased them. I had an addiction to the unobtainable, and the unobtainable only became increasingly unobtainable. Until it wasn’t. </p>
<p>I had never felt anything before like the love I felt in my most shameful state standing over Jenny in her most vulnerable state. It was not a feeling of butterflies in my stomach. It was a willingness to give up myself for her in her brief moment of need. I had felt it before in my last moments with George, but as my awe grew with all its fear and wonder at existence, so did the consequences when it came time for the world, a part of which was for me, to also dictate Jenny’s fate. Then it was as if I had finally obtained the great experience of life of willingly wrestling with destiny and death, if only for a brief moment, and its power over all else was apparent; How else could I go from an infinite awe at my own existence, to a willingness to sacrifice it all in an instant? Was there any more unyielding an addiction? For as quick as an all-consuming story once unobtainable not only become obtainable but was in the process of being obtained, did my perspective pivot to it being actually the horizon that distracted me from Jenny, and I was plagued with impatience in the aftermath waiting to see if she could forgive me.</p>
<p>I wanted to scrub myself clean. I wanted a warm shower, but there was no warm water at my house. I needed a warm shower, and there was a family that I knew of who always got home late at night on Mondays and would certainly have warm water. They wouldn’t be home for at least another hour. Soccer practice, church, family night out—whatever it was, the house was empty on Mondays when we would pass it running by George’s, and it was empty when I drove by it on my way home from Jenny’s.</p>
<p>As I tied my shoes, I noticed the light on downstairs. Dad had arrived home at some point during my wandering. I snuck outside without catching him and left. I drove cautiously by backroads to avoid passing near the Lebedevs. When I reached the house, I continued down the street and parked between the property lines of two yards so neither neighbor knew if it was for the other.</p>
<p>Once I was out of my car and away from my license plate, I didn’t care if anyone saw my face. I strolled to the house with my gym bag on my shoulder. A car drove by. I thought nothing of it. A woman walked her dog opposite of me. I greeted her as I passed her. A couple of kids played in a yard while their dad mowed the lawn. I continued up the driveway across the street and tried the front door. It opened. I entered without hesitation as if I’d left the door unlocked myself. </p>
<p>I found my way to the master bathroom and locked myself in, then shed my clothes and turned the bath to its hottest notch. I started music on my phone and set it on the counter. As soon as steam rose from the tub, I plugged the drain and stepped in. When the water rose near the edge, I shut it off and laid back with my ears beneath the scalding water, silencing the world to all but my thoughts. I took a deep sigh and wondered, what was it like for Jenny? What was it like for her to lay back in the water and fall asleep?</p>
