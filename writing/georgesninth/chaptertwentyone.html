								<h2 style="text-align: center">By Hayden Gemeinhardt</h2><br>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">Chapter Twenty One</h1><br>
<p>I never meant to lose my mind, but there wasn’t much of a say to be had in what happened to me, for every night I blindly clung for threads hoping that my cry would be answered, as nothing I grasped could be worse than giving in to my fear. Then one night, my fingers wrapped around the devil’s long, polished nails that outstretched a sweet decadence as but an offering. It was the icy hand of death, the hot hand of lust, the simmering, shaking hand of the future whose tantalizing touch was of a dream where fame and beauty and money would make all else fade away.</p>
<p>“Why dwell on questions,” she asked, “when there is a lifetime of answers for you to explore? You, who call yourself a seeker of adventure, who merely voyages along the charted coast of his town, and shakes his fist at the calm waters if but to summon a storm? Must you know there is no odyssey here?”</p>
<p>She touted like the cell was only limited to my imagination. Like I could leave at any time and pick the world up where George had left off. Like the real world was beyond the physical realm. My hand grazed along the rough concrete walls to the cold bars at the front of the cell. I had heard the same words before, spewed from my own mouth towards others. To be accused of such sins myself? Must she not know who I am, Mickey Lee? </p>
<p>“If there was an answer,” I replied, wrapping my hands tightly around the bars, “and it had been found, why would the world prefer to watch me rot away than to share this answer?”</p>
<p>“Answers have been regurgitated into colloquialisms, but they are only for interpretations of the question that are expected to be held like a cultural etiquette. An interpretation that you, in fact, held until recently, and now spit upon, yet you still turn your cheek to the new one before you.”</p>
<p>I shook my head and returned to my bed. “Tell me, then, what is the answer to this newfound world I’ve drifted into? Enlighten me. Share the good news.”</p>
<p>She pulled a cart of treats from the wall. “Feast and you shall see.”</p>
<p>I laughed. “Feast? This is absurd. Just tell me.”</p>
<p>“Since when did you prefer to listen than to pursue, to believe they are the same?”</p>
<p>The truth was, the path I trekked along was treacherous. The soles of my shoes were so worn that the pebbles which glittered them from routes long past were losing their hold. My knees began to hurt more than my lungs or legs, which meant my route was overstayed. Yet there was no end in sight.</p>
<p>The chase of the thrill was an addiction I was incapable of managing and unable to break free from. I would be quicker to join George on his journey than return to a life without. But there was only so much further I could push before my body caved in. </p>
<p>I eyed the cart, level upon level of cakes and pastries and cookies and puddings. If I pursued it and found nothing, I would have spent all I had remaining and that would be the end of my story. </p>
<p>I collapsed onto the bed and looked at the gray ceiling. “It would take me days to get through—”</p>
<p>“Months, my child.”</p>
<p>“—and I don’t know if I can last much longer. I am desperate for an answer!”</p>
<p>“I understand, but to simply taste is not enough. To savor it, you must grow accustomed to it. It must be natural and routine. It must come without a second thought. Like all things, it comes with time. No amount of will can deny that.”</p>
<p>“It’s not truth then,” I said. “It’s finding a new perspective that makes old quotes look like truth. It’s an antidepressant wrapped in sweets. Therapy, not victory.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “You don’t want a new answer, do you? You merely want your preconceived notions to be righted again. But they were never wronged and you are still too blind to see that.” She kicked the brake off the wheels and began rolling the cart away.</p>
<p>They were never wronged?</p>
<p>It might result in the end, but if I found even the slightest respite from this glorious nightmare, would the risk not be a last stand worthy of lust? Would George lie in bed awaiting the remaining ticks of time, or would he have already lunged at the opportunity?</p>
<p>“Wait!” I called, jumping out of bed. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>She stopped midway between the bars. A wry smile crept around the side of her cheek, far wider than any natural smile. She turned around. “You think you disproved the notions that founded your life, when all you did was slam the door closed on them.”</p>
<p>“Is not this world meaningless? Am I not just an animal doing what chemicals tell me to do?”</p>
<p>She kneeled at my feet to meet my level. Her stare was piercing. It was like looking into the eyes of an ancient drake whose pupil was as deep as the night sky and iris the color of an eclipse. “You know so little about yourself you couldn’t tell me if you had a soul,” she said, mockingly pitiful, her nail poking at my chest, then swirled the back of her hand up around my cheek and cupped the back of my head with her soft hand. “You couldn’t tell me if this whole world was imagined by your brain floating in a void. You couldn’t tell me what consciousness was, that which is the birth of your being itself. How can you not know what you are, yet still claim to be ridden by the knowledge of what you think yourself to be?”</p>
<p>Her eyes were mesmerizing. To hold contact was exhausting, but my eyes were lured like magnets, unable to break away except by some outside force. </p>
<p>“You do not have the right,” she continued, “to ignore the complexities of your life and then whine about the simplistic views you derived. I believe you said that yourself. So why are you doing that now?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know!” I pouted, like a child would whilst stamping their foot.</p>
<p>The devil rose and walked behind me. She clasped my shoulders and bent down to my ear. “Remember where it all started? Remember why you ended up here?”</p>
<p>Of course, I remembered. How could I not? It was that which became my identity for months with no say of mine, proof that George truly made the world his. His death which started it all.</p>
<p>“No,” she said, breaking my pause. “That’s not it. Where did it really begin?”</p>
<p>Her voice tickled my ear, but her answer jumped my heart. Had she known me well enough to predict my thoughts? Her thumbs massaged into my traps, gently urging an answer. “With college applications?” I sputtered.</p>
<p>“Almost,” she replied, moving her hands down my back.</p>
<p>“That day in the café. It was that day! I remember it so vividly. Lucas and I reading our drafts…” I turned around and looked up to her. “How can you say no?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember your affliction against the wealthy? Not of jealousy but of principle. You said they were blind! That they were immoral, complacent, that taking from them was only right!”</p>
<p>“But what does that have to do with anything?”</p>
<p>“Because you yourself have fallen into that trap. Too frightened to see the world as it really is, for you would be incapable of embracing the reality of it if it were true.”</p>
<p>As she spoke, all the memories rushed back, flickering in her deep eyes a reflection of my past. All the stories I lived but never concluded. Dreams that could have been but never were. Always incapable of taking hold of the world that brought my life meaning no matter what meaninglessness I could conjecture in wake of my failures.</p>
<p>She pulled my trembling hand to her cart. It was over. She won.</p>
<p>“Feast,” she said, and thus I did.</p>
<p>It was impossible not to feast and savor upon such blasphemous ideology when I, as a starving animal, was spat upon much the same. A single bite was enough to fill anyone’s stomach, yet I had such a ravenous appetite that the more I ate, the more I craved. I became such a gluttonous fool that it was impossible to stay my hand and inconceivable as to why I had done so for so long.</p>
<p>She first fed me delicacies that were familiar in the bite-sized pieces I tasted as a runner, those cherry-picked quotes from Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus. Sentences that I disregarded on their own because they were the thoughts of men who had nothing left. But the devil didn’t merely give me the small candies. She gave me the whole platter, and upon tasting it as it was meant to be tasted, I learned that the understanding of the stoics was all wrong! Earthly pleasures were not unimportant because they were fleeting; rather, they had become frivolous in comparison to the pursuit of knowledge and meaning, for nothing is more important to a starving beast than that which feeds it.</p>
<p>The next time I talked to Hugo, I divulged him on the thoughts. He was happy for me but didn’t seem to care. How could he if he had not experienced the meal I had? The definitions of the words I used were still the same, but the meanings had transformed into something entirely different for me. I was talking past Hugo, for we weren’t speaking the same language. Surely, then, I’d have to keep her a secret. He couldn’t know about her. He wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p>“It’s an interesting thought though,” I said, “because I’ve found value in this pursuit, despite it being the most lethargic at times. In the past, that which had value was that which I felt emotion over, but now it’s more like that which I feel emotion over is that which has value.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the same thing?” Hugo asked.</p>
<p>“No, because something can have value without an emotional attachment!”</p>
<p>What a revelation that was! It had completely dissimulated the whole damn dilemma. The dependency of thrills was removed from the value of life! The question that carried me along the entire journey was answered. All in a single sentence. </p>
<p>It was impossible to explain the significance that sentence carried, as the paradigms that made the answer possible had only been formed because of the journey I went on. The journey meant nothing to anyone but me, for it was not their journey but mine. In fact, had the answer been given to me months before, I would not have accepted it for the same reason. Yet, it was a sentence that transformed the world from a bleak winter whose snow I trudged through out of spite into a blissful dream that was so overwhelming I might had been more suicidal than before. But it was far from solving the problem. Such was the catch with her delicacies: Before an answer was found for one question, concomitant questions were already raised for any possible answer.</p>
<p>I returned to her eagerly begging for more, pleading on my knees for just another bite. She bent down and cupped my chin, pulling it up so I could meet her pitiful eyes. She sat me on the bed in my cell and told me that I was not ready, and that I should rest and wait until the new realizations settled in my soul. Then a week later, I awoke to her sitting at the edge of my bed with a fresh cart of her finest treats.</p>
<p>Through the months, she fed me logic, ethics, and physics—all from Kant’s transcendentalism and Monoism versus Dualism to Godel’s incompleteness theorem and the death of local realism. Each new theory shifted my paradigms into deep trenches that had no maps to navigate. When the time came to resurface for a breath of fresh air, my hands scratched against the tops of the trenches that had sneakily shifted to caverns amidst the darkness. The only choice was to keep swimming in hopes of finding a pocket of air.</p>
<p>She handed me spoonful after spoonful and I shoved each down my throat: absurdism, Marxism, hedonism, solipsism, moral relativism—None of it was natural.</p>
<p>When I struggled, she would always ask, “What’s the matter, my son? Do you want more?”</p>
<p>“There’s more?” I’d reply, frantically.</p>
<p>“Of course. I always have more. Eat.”</p>
<p>And so I ate and ate and ate.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before I said, “I think I’m going insane.”</p>
<p>She ran her fingers through my hair, brushing it aside as her long nails gently grazing my scalp. “Child, might I remind you where you were before I came to you?”</p>
<p>“I know that I was a misfit. This is different though.”</p>
<p>“You were rebellious and that is only natural. But that is not what I am talking about.”</p>
<p>“Deranged, psychotic, freakish?” I frantically spat out.</p>
<p>She caressed me in her arms. “Shhh. It’s okay. You were ill.”</p>
<p>“I was lost!”</p>
<p>“You were looking for a cure,” she said with a consoling tone, pulling my head to rest against her bosom, “No one should blame you for that.”</p>
<p>“Everyone else struggles with the same thoughts,” I cried, “yet none of them take this path. I am the only one I know whose fear of meaninglessness and death led to becoming an outcast and a fiend.”</p>
<p>“Others let their struggles affect the world in different ways. They preach hate to those they don’t agree with. They hurt their families and friends and manipulate their loved ones. If given the chance, they would rage wars and enslave societies to fill their own unfillable void. Do you think they are better?”</p>
<p>“Maybe not,” I sobbed. “But if I say one thing and everyone says the other, then maybe I am wrong.”</p>
<p>“Do not let anyone shame you for trying to escape those pits. They will drag you back in but to save their own dignity. You must remember what it was like.” </p>
<p>“How do I know that I am escaping?”</p>
<p>“It may be impossible for you to see,” she said, “but if you continue to carry yourself as a miserable wretch who is ashamed of the awe you found in the world and too insecure to give home to thoughts that distinguish yourself from others, you’ll certainly never escape the abyss you found yourself in.”</p>
<p>“What if I’m going the wrong way?” I asked. “Is insanity any better, or is it but a different, deeper abyss?”</p>
<p>“To be seen as insane is the price you pay in the position you are in to live the life that makes all who gaze upon it jealous of the world you’ve created for yourself. To transcend a complacent life, you must accept an ambition that would make a complacent mass—or, more importantly, an otherwise complacent version of yourself—uncomfortable. But discomfort should not make you turn back. Neither theirs nor yours. In fact, you must be willing to lose all that you find dear. Thus, it is only when you are most desperate that you are ready to make the change. That is why I have waited to find you until now, my son,” she said, kissing the top of my head.</p>
<p>Her words were like poison, but her embrace was soothing in a way I had never felt. A deep, nourishing love. A foundation that would always be there. A wrap that I could fall asleep in.</p>
<p>But just as the hint of a yawn would fill my lungs, she would set me upright and backhand my right cheek. She would wiggle her finger about my nose, her nail tapping its tip, and remind me that I was in the midst of the most monumental story, whose grandeur was solely dependent on my constant pursuit. Any wavering was lost time I could not recover. So, after a short discourse, I would continue the journey. It was difficult, but far from dreadful, for it was neither trifling nor tedious.</p>
<p>“This world you have shown me, mother,” I said, “it is so beautiful! How can an existence so full of awe hide behind itself?”</p>
<p>“It isn’t hidden at all, my dear. No more than gravity.”</p>
<p>“But I would have never found it if you didn’t show it to me.”</p>
<p>“That is because it is only significant insofar as you can utilize it. You have every use for it, so much that it is a necessity for your own perpetuation. Once you realize that, then it is hard to understand how you hadn’t realized it before.”</p>
<p>She cared for me through the end of my sentence. Because of her, I could no longer have said my time was punishment. Every moment with her was a moment I couldn’t imagine life without.</p>
<p>When the day came for me to leave the gray cell behind me, she said, “Go! I will still be with you, but it is time for you to continue your journey in the real world. Remember all that I have taught you, and never be afraid to ask for more when you are hungry. And never, ever fool yourself into believing that your hunger has been satisfied for eternity, or you will have learned nothing at all.”</p>
<p>It was the last delicacy on her cart, quickly devoured if but for a quicker release from the prison. I gulped the last bits of food and kissed her goodbye.</p>
