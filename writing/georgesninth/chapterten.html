<p>“This school is something else, you know?” Hugo said whilst waving a bottle of orange juice around from across the table. “This shit was gold at my other school, and here they hand it out for lunch.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “I guess I never really thought about it.”</p>
<p>A gust of cold wind swept through the covered courtyard, swaying the empty trees. I stuffed my hands in the armpits of my jacket and crunched forward, waiting for the next bell to finally ring so I could get the day over with. The changing of the seasons was the only reminder that time was passing—even though the transition was too slow for anyone to take the reminder seriously, like slowly boiling a frog alive—and I couldn’t imagine any more of a way to blend the days together than with never-changing weather. Oh, how naturally people love consistent weather!</p>
<p>But why Hugo insisted we sat outside was not to escape the consistency of the indoors. I wasn’t quite sure what his reasoning was, though. He wasn’t a masochist like my old friends used to be. He was entirely different. He was also the only interesting person left in the school, and he knew so little about who I used to be that it was easy to change who I was without interrupting twelve grades of status quo, for he had only started going to TRHS at the beginning of the year after bussing legislation passed—legislation that was diversity in name only as the kids they deemed advantageous to bus in were no different than the ones they selected to bus out.</p>
<p>“You know what we got?” Hugo said. “Fucking milk. And only milk." He slammed the bottle back down. "Lactose intolerant? Sucks. Drink from the fountain.”</p>
<p>“If it bothered you that much, you could’ve just brought water."</p>
<p>Hugo pulled his head back in unexpected offense. Then he laughed and pointed his finger at me, bobbing it in the air. “See, this is what I’ve been talking about.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Have you ever really wanted orange juice but couldn’t get it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really drink it.”</p>
<p>“Pretend you did.”</p>
<p>I pulled out my hands from the jacket and rubbed the tired from my face, groaning between my palms, “I don’t know, man.”</p>
<p>“You used to run, right? And after a long run, I imagine you chugged water like there’s no tomorrow. And I’d also bet you were always able to get water after a run.”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. It’s water.”</p>
<p>“And if you ever wanted orange juice for lunch, well, it’s just orange juice, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Exactly!” he shouted. “It’s just orange juice, you’d say. What’s the big deal?”</p>
<p>Why was he so damn passionate about orange juice? I leaned onto the table and propped my head, thumbing the gritty rubber grille of the lunch table. “I don’t see what you’re getting at.”</p>
<p>“How do I put this—” Hugo pondered, shook his head, and blurted, “Have you ever really wanted anything you couldn’t get it?”</p>
<p>Who else but Hugo could’ve asked such a blunt question? He gazed at me, waiting patiently for an answer. I looked away, trying to think, catching sight of Lucas across the courtyard cheerfully wrapping his arms around new friends, then turned back to Hugo. “No, and I don’t think I like that.”</p>
<p>“Like what?” Megan asked, having returned from throwing the remains of her lunch away.</p>
<p>“Free orange juice,” Hugo said, twisting the bottle open. “You got me fucked up, Mickey. If you wanna go to Pineville so bad, I’m sure there’s spots available.”</p>
<p>Megan sighed and sat down on the bench next to me. “Pineville this, Pineville that—”</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t last a day over there,” Hugo said, bringing the bottle to his lips.</p>
<p>“Is it really that bad?” I asked.</p>
<p>Hugo hand signed so-so between a gulp of orange juice then wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist. “Plenty of jerks, just different kinds of jerks than here.”</p>
<p>“I might prefer it,” Megan replied to Hugo. “Mickey’s one of the few guys around here who hasn’t grabbed my ass over the years.”</p>
<p>“Just doing my best,” I said.</p>
<p>“What about me?” Hugo asked.</p>
<p>She flicked her hair. “It has hardly been a month and my hopes aren’t high for drunk Hugo.”</p>
<p>He laughed. “Drunk Hugo is legendary.”</p>
<p>“Drunk Hugo?” I asked. “Even I haven’t had the privilege to witness that.”</p>
<p>“She hasn’t either.”</p>
<p>“Oh but I will,” Megan said. “Party at my place this Saturday.”</p>
<p>“You haven’t thrown many parties, have you?” Hugo asked.</p>
<p>“I sure as shit have.”</p>
<p>Everyone—except Hugo—knew Megan’s house was the best place to have parties. Sure, I could’ve hosted parties. My family had a nice house in a nice part of a nice town. My place was not as good as those like Lucas’s though, and Megan’s was simply on another level compared to them. A motor court large enough to hold most people’s cars and parents that were hardly there to occupy a spot themselves was all that needed to be said.</p>
<p>“Well, here’s a little secret,” Hugo said, leaning towards her, “If you’re going to throw a party, don’t announce it on Monday.”</p>
<p>“I’m not announcing it. I’m just making sure you two are there, because it’s for you two.” She turned to me. “That means you’re coming whether you like it or not.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” I said.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t a question.”</p>
<p>“Have you even been to one of her parties?” Hugo asked.</p>
<p>“Believe it or not,” Megan said, “Mickey and his friends used to be the life of the party, until that incident a while back.”</p>
<p>“Incident?” Hugo asked.</p>
<p>I waved it off. Megan wasn’t too happy about that and I didn’t want her remembering. “Well, good news is we don’t have to worry about that anymore.”</p>
<p>Hugo groaned. “Jesus, we gotta get you out of the house. You’re going to that party. And you’re going out with us tonight.”</p>
<p>“I’m not third wheeling.”</p>
<p>“We’re not dating, yet,” Hugo said, winking at Megan.</p>
<p>Megan winced. “We’re not even close.”</p>
<p>“Closer than last week.”</p>
<p>“Yet here you keep introducing me to guys better than you. Not a very smart plan.”</p>
<p>“Fine. Mickey, just you and me brother.”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “Now I’m not going out unless Megan comes along—”</p>
<p>They both smiled and high-fived.</p>
<p>“—but I never said I was going out.”</p>
<p>“Sounded like that to me,” Hugo said as the bell rang. “Sounded like that to you Megan?”</p>
<p>“Sure did,” Megan said, smiling at me. “See you at eight, Mickey.”</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>When I got home from work, I kicked off my shoes, set my backpack on my chair, and collapsed into bed with a deep yawn. I had homework to finish and tests to study for that I normally would do early so the night was free, but I did not need a free night. I did not have a life to live outside of school that would necessitate freedom of any sort.</p>
<p>Life was so much simpler that way. My body had shed itself of its vestigial appendages, and once the all-consuming need was no longer a need, the energy was no longer spent, the body stopped supplying it, and I had no more energy than to scroll idly on my phone for mediocre thrills that lasted mere seconds. Ten thousand tiny thrills that lasted seconds transcended one grand thrill that lasted ten thousand days. That was what they always said the secret to life was—to focus on the small things. So, I did, and I nearly fell asleep,</p>
<p>A hundred miniscule thrills later, Dad called me down for dinner. Since we always got home at the same time, we always ate together at the same time. With Mom gone, we always ate the same meal, and he always asked the same questions.</p>
<p>“How’s school going?” Dad asked, stabbing a piece of asparagus.</p>
<p>“The usual,” I said. </p>
<p>Our silverware clinked against the plates as we ate. Flint panted down the side of my leg. Broadcasters discussed sports analytics from the television in the living room. The same as yesterday, the same as today, the same as tomorrow. </p>
<p>“Have you been working on your applications?”</p>
<p>“I’m still taking a break,” I said, “trying to see if any new ideas pop up.”</p>
<p>“Don’t wait too long, or the deadline will come.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know.”</p>
<p>Dad laughed. “I’m not worried. When I was in school, we’d always wait until just before it was due. But then the deadline adrenaline would kick in, and we’d get it done in no time.”</p>
<p>I chocked another goddamned piece of chicken down my throat. How much more chicken could I eat? My hunger was once fueled by running, but in hibernation, hunger did not exist. It was not that I wanted to stay in a constant half-asleep state. It was that I knew no way to wake up. Still, the remainder of the chicken on my plate demanded an answer: was it going to be eaten or left for Flint?</p>
<p>That wasn’t the real question, though. No, it was the burning of my appendix, the one fatal flaw my body failed to rid itself of, the piece that wanted to stand against a universe that would crush it if it tried: what would George do? </p>
<p>I took another bite. Stray pieces lodged themselves stuck between my teeth. </p>
<p>It was true that I was lonely in a world that was not the world I thought it to be. It was equally true that I was sad because I wasn’t like George, where a life of stories was as natural as the color of his hair. But there was another truth that was forgotten the moment I lost him—when I ran alongside him, I didn’t want to be as fast as him; I wanted to be faster. Not for the sake of stating I was faster, but because it gave me something to fight against. It was the one thing I still valued. The everlasting desire that transcended animalism. </p>
<p>I stood with the world upon my shoulders whether I liked it or not—that much was the price of being. The world was heavy, and George was a belt to brace against. With him gone, it was like the floor disappeared entirely. Only, the floor was still there; I had merely lost the belt. Did that not make the squat all the more exciting?</p>
<p>There were two kinds of people in the world: people who drank because their father drank, and people who didn’t drink because their father drank. Those who strove for a life because they were depressed, and those who didn’t strive for a life because they are depressed. I knew which I was. I was Mickey fucking Lee. I strove against complacency, not to be at the top of the herd, but to truly taste living on a path of difficulty above that of an animal who only cared about safely reaching the end of the easy road. Then why did I need to wait and let the universe dictate when I finally did something? Why did I need a call to action to justify doing something?</p>
<p>I didn’t need to be born into royalty or wealth or power. I didn’t need a backstory for permission to pursue something. Of course, they say there’s always a reason for doing something. But why did it require my mother battling cancer for me to justify wanting to be a doctor? Was it not good enough to simply say I wanted to cure diseases? Why were those whose reasoning was dictated by tragedy praised above all others? Was the determination of our minds, the nuances of our lives, and our awe at the natural beauties of the world not enough to justify—meaningfully justify—our hearts ablaze? My gaze lifted, eyeing the cake that was the mountain I had yet to finish climbing. </p>
<p>So, when Dad asked, “Do you have anything planned for tonight?  The game is about to be on.”</p>
<p>I said, “I’m going out.”</p>
<p>And he raised his glass to his lips to hide his surprise.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>The difference between American cities and their European counterparts is American cities are known by their skyline and European cities are known by their landmarks. Newport was one of the few in America that were marked by both—by the skyline as seen from my window, and the ostentatious Grand Plaza from on the ground below. It was the place to be when hanging out with friends. There was no reason to go anywhere else. Even on Monday nights, one had to park on the upper floors of the parking garage.</p>
<p>Hugo and Megan weren’t the type of people I was used to hanging out with. Hugo was too easy-going, and Megan was too vivacious, and the two of them together were quite goofy. That was what was expected of high schoolers though, and I had no right to complain.</p>
<p>I caught sight of Hugo on my drive up the ramp of the garage. He was scouring for a close parking spot. I went straight to the top and parked in a nearly empty row facing the railing, then hopped down the stairs to wait for Hugo at the bottom. I was surprised to see him there before me.</p>
<p>“You know there’s an elevator,” Hugo said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I’m impatient.”</p>
<p>“It’s literally faster.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “Where’s Megan? What’s the plan?”</p>
<p>“She’ll be here any minute,” Hugo said, distracted as he looked down the street for her car. “We’re hitting Cedar’s.”</p>
<p>“Cedar’s?”</p>
<p>“The bar.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have to be twenty one?”</p>
<p>Hugo laughed. “Surely George raised you better than that.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have a fake if that’s what you’re insisting.”</p>
<p>His smile dropped. “Seriously? Why didn’t you say anything?”</p>
<p>“Because I didn’t know we were going to Cedar’s.”</p>
<p>Hugo ignored me and called Megan. After a couple of rings, she picked up, and Hugo said, “Yo, plan’s changed. Mickey doesn’t have a fake.”</p>
<p>He flinched as Megan screamed into his ear, then switched it to speaker. “Why didn’t he say anything?”</p>
<p>“Because I didn’t know!” I yelled at the phone.</p>
<p>“Did you forget it at home?” Megan questioned. “Go back and get it.”</p>
<p>“No, I—forget it, I don’t have it, okay?”</p>
<p>Megan audibly sighed. “One second, I see you two now.”</p>
<p>The phone call ended, and moments later, a white Mercedes pulled up next to us and rolled down its window. Megan rested her elbow where the glass had been, and her other hand hung from the top of the steering wheel. “We’ll get you in somehow,” she said to me, “Into one of the bars, at least. There’s enough to go around.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think any of us look remotely old enough,” I said, eyeing a car that slowed to a halt behind began.</p>
<p>“Just stand on your tippy toes,” Hugo said, slapping me on the back.</p>
<p>There was a striking difference between sneaking into a house and sneaking into a bar, yet it was the latter I hesitated with, like there was a sense of guilt. Would I have hesitated if it was Lucas and George?</p>
<p>The car behind Megan let out a long honk when it became apparent Megan was not moving. Hugo and Megan flipped him off. </p>
<p>“Mickey,” Megan asked, “where’d you park?”</p>
<p>“Third floor, next to the stairs. You’ll see it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t wanna park next to me?” Hugo asked. </p>
<p>She pulled away before he received an answer.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The trick to sneaking in a bar was more similar to trying to get into a university than a house. All doors were guarded, and you had to convince the owner to let you in when they had no reason to do so. It would’ve been a fun, daring game, but we decided it wasn’t worth the trouble and chose a bar that checked ID at the counter than the door, and then Hugo and Megan would order drinks for me.</p>
<p>“Why don’t I ever see you with Lucas anymore?” Megan asked, sitting in between Hugo and I with a glass of beer.</p>
<p>“We just don’t talk anymore,” I said. “Nothing really to it.”</p>
<p>“You guys were inseparable for years, and now nothing? Doesn’t seem right.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you want me to say.”</p>
<p>Hugo chimed in from across Megan, “At least make up a story.”</p>
<p>“And spread lies?”</p>
<p>“Well, something is going to spread as truth one way or another. Best you decide what that is going to be.”</p>
<p>“It’s been a month,” I said. “Whatever rumors that would’ve come about would’ve by now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, they have,” Megan said, “I was wondering if they were true.”</p>
<p>“They’re probably not far off,” I said. I took a long sip of the drink, hoping that whatever truth was to come from my mouth would be closest to itself. “I could tell for a long time that Lucas and I were simply steering towards different paths in life that made us grow farther and farther apart, to the point that the only thing we shared was George. I think we were both expecting things to taper off when we moved off to college.”</p>
<p>Megan nodded with satisfaction, but Hugo leaned in and asked, “Do you ever think about trying to fix it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but things won’t be the same. To the degree that we were close, it is not enough to only be a fraction of what it once was with a sour after taste.”</p>
<p>“Maybe so,” Hugo said, “but you don’t have the least bit of anticipation of finding out if it is true?”</p>
<p>“I know it to be true!” I shot back. “I tried, but in the end, it was Lucas who moved on.”</p>
<p>Megan had a look of confusion as though she doubted it was true. Clearly the rumors had spread.</p>
<p>“Why do you think he stopped talking to you?” Hugo asked.</p>
<p>“Because I couldn’t get over George,” I said plainly.</p>
<p>“And what’s stopping you from doing that?”</p>
<p>Hugo was dead serious on an answer. What a question that was, to expect an answer for a question that was not meant to be answered! One of those questions that only went one-why deep before reaching its sandy bottom. It was one of those questions that we were only expected to ask ourselves and be satisfied just to have asked them. Hugo cared more than that and expected more than that from me.</p>
<p>My head had grown light. I asked the bartender for a large glass of water and handed the rest of my drink to Megan who was more than happy to take it.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s not so much his death that saddens me,” I said. “I am sad for no other reason than my own spite, and I’m not sure what to do about it.”</p>
<p>“Drink it down tonight,” Hugo said, chugging the last bit of his drink then slamming the glass on the table, “and purge it in the morning. Much like you Mickey, I should be spiteful to all. I should also be home studying for tests right now. I value my time more than that. No one forces you to be spiteful. That is a choice you make yourself.”</p>
<p>“But I can’t just ignore my own feelings.”</p>
<p>Hugo shrugged.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>It was nicknamed the Grand Plaza because it was the centerpiece of a local wealthy real-estate agency that was as pretentious and as portentous and as pompous as promised and populated by walking thousand dollar suits and thousand dollar shoes and thousand dollar wallets and purses. There were luxury clothing stores, jewelry stores, and steak houses. There was an art gallery and an aquarium, a movie theater and an arcade, a bowling alley and a Ferris wheel. In the middle spanned a forest of oak trees, flower beds, hedges, fountains, and a magnificent pond-sized water feature. </p>
<p>There weren’t many places in the city to walk, so if one ever found themselves in the park, one always took the opportunity. We strolled along the side paths through the park, shifting into the grass when the path grew too narrow as other groups came from the other direction—which happened so often that Hugo ended up permanently in the grass. Then Megan’s phone rang, and she excused herself to find her dad, who apparently was also at the Grand Plaza that night. Hugo and I waited for her off the sidewalk near the pond, apart from the scattered crowd of groups and couples anticipating the moonlit show soon to start.</p>
<p>“You sure you don’t want to get closer?” Hugo asked.</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” I said, “I’ve seen it a million times.”</p>
<p>The lamps around the area dimmed. The voices of the surrounding audience hushed. Gentle keystrokes of a piano filled the atmosphere with a bright tune. The pond was illuminated white like an ice-skating rink. Streams of water accentuated by a rainbow of lights shot into the air from an array of jets twisting about in a theatrical dance to the song.</p>
<p>I nudged Hugo with my elbow. “You know a fraction of the cost of this water show could’ve done George’s family a lot of good.” All the spectators could have helped George’s family. All of them. But their self-esteem to prove to the world of their worth is more important than his mother. I would bet every single one of them would walk by him had he been begging in the streets.</p>
<p>“Yet here we are staring at it,” Hugo said. "It could do a lot of other good in this world too, but who are you to decide who gets it?”</p>
<p>“It could help anyone, but it’s helping no one.”</p>
<p>“Right, it’s just being beautiful. Like a waterfall in the woods.”</p>
<p>“How much more beautiful would life have been for those who would be lifted out of poverty by this?”</p>
<p>“This is nothing compared to all the movies and music and paintings and—where do you really draw the line?”</p>
<p>“Maybe I wouldn’t mind it so much if they contributed some part back--” The air slipped from my lungs as a girl caught my shoulder while walking past, staring at her phone with no awareness or care to the world around her. The crowd was slowly dispersing as the show continued, namely those only there for their own five-second story to prove to their peers that their life was interesting.</p>
<p>A cloud of mist formed over the white pond. A projection reflected off the droplets hovering in the dark. Two silhouettes danced in shutter shock film, a dress spinning under the finger of a tux. Along the sidewalk in front of us strolled a suited man taking more enjoyment in watching others watch the show than watching the show himself. We locked eyes for a brief moment in which he smiled and waved with an energy that would make anyone question who could hate such a gentle soul, but one look at his wrist that waved in the air told me who he really was.</p>
<p>“Where’s the line?” Hugo repeated. “Tell me, what percentage of their wealth must be given away to make them good again?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that they need to donate some percent of their wealth. It’s that they are stubborn to part with their wealth even when it would mean saving someone’s life while having no effect on theirs.”</p>
<p>“Are you surprised? How can you hate an animal that does what it is naturally created to do? How can you hate a dog for barking at the mail man, or a bird flying away when the cage is left open, or a tiger hunting for innocent prey in the wild?”</p>
<p>“Humans are not dogs nor birds nor tigers. A dog or bird or tiger cannot be evil, and I do not expect anything of them.”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s your problem,” Hugo said. “You expect things of people you have no right expecting.”</p>
<p>“Is it really wrong to expect people to act better than a bunch of animals?”</p>
<p>“To be spiteful over it is just as animalistic, don’t you think? To take the easy route? It’s easy to hate reality, and hard to accept it and love it and cherish it just as much as a parent would their child. Nothing is ever right that is easy, but we only have this one world. Why hate it? What do you stand to gain? A place to blame all your troubles with no way of reconciliation so that you may never need to go through the effort of reconciling at all? It’s not worth throwing away the joy in life. It’s just not.”</p>
<p>The depth of his words would not be understood until many months later, but they stunned me nonetheless— It wasn’t right! He was supposed to be the complacent one that merely existed without qualm nor question. He was supposed to be the one spiteful of the wealthy, and the friend who agreed and affirmed my thoughts. Yet he shrugged it off.</p>
<p>I sighed and grabbed his shoulder. “Tonight, all you’ve done is made my life all the more difficult.”</p>
<p>“All I’ve done is point out your inconsistencies,” Hugo replied, “and the biggest one that strikes me is you seemingly hate the rich. But you yourself are wealthy. And you yourself are friends with Megan, of all people—”</p>
<p>“I am friends with Megan,” I interrupted, “because she is friends with you.”</p>
<p>“But you’re her friend, nonetheless. And you’re out here spending your night with her.”</p>
<p>“What is she doing out here with you anyway? I never understood why you two are friends.”</p>
<p>“She’s out here for you, dude.” He laughed and nudged me with his elbow. “Not me. You were the one that caught her eye. Which I don’t get, because right now, you’re just like everyone else out here except you whine. I ask, so what? I’m sick and tired of hearing your whining. You do absolutely nothing and it baffles me because I don’t take you to be a loser. What’s the hold up?”</p>
<p>“What am I to do about it?” </p>
<p>“Something other than rot in your miserable state. Whatever the hell it takes. Maybe come join the rest of us in our mindless, animalistic state you claim we sit in and stop throwing labels on everything. But at the very least, just stop whining, for God’s sake.”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The elevator chimed at the top floor. Its doors parted. Megan and I stepped out into the desolate lot where only scattered cars remained. Megan’s was parked next to mine, overlooking the ledge that peered down into the Grand Plaza. As we neared them, just as the goodbye settled on my tongue, Megan grabbed my wrist. She jerked me past and pulled me to the railing.</p>
<p>The steel was icy to the touch, but as I overlooked the ledge that dropped down far below, I anxiously gripped it tight. Light streamed onto the streets from the windows of shops. The pond danced in the distance. A chilly breeze rustled the trees. </p>
<p>Behind us, far off into the hills, was my window with its dominating view. But as dominating the view was from my room, I could never have distinguished Megan from so far away. There, in the city, amongst its inhabitants as one of them, I could see her, looking down to her hand being death-gripped by mine.</p>
<p>I let go, but I did not pull my hand away. I was frozen. I was locked in her gaze. Everything about her was perfect—that if the scene she thought she saw in front of her truly was an artist’s rendition of Starry Night, it was a backdrop to her beauty. Her long, braided hair that ran down clothing that only wealth could buy, hiding a body that was chiseled to perfection, the confidence in her eyes, the biting of her lip.</p>
<p>She was so fucking perfect. She was everything I hated.</p>
<p>She moved her head towards mine, her hands around the back of my neck. Her lips to my lips.</p>
<p>Who could resist the moment? Even the most devoted partner would falter in their steps only to savor one more taste of her cherry lipstick before pulling themselves together. I passionately returned her kiss. I wanted to savor her. But it was she who savored me. It was she who clasped the back of my hair, pushed my ass against the railing, and sent the fear of falling down my spine while wrapping me tight in her arms so I wouldn’t fall, but only selfishly so she could have me.</p>
<p>She led me toward the tinted windows of her car and climbed into the back seat. I followed and closed the door behind me, then straddled over her and weaved my fingers into her hair. As I kissed her deeper, she slid her hand up the back of my shirt, her cold hands sending a wave of goosebumps up my spine. Her nails trailed back down and grabbed the hem of my shirt. She jerked it over my head and onto the floor, then ran her thumb along the crevices of my abs. She rolled me over onto the next seat so that she looked down at me. Then her shirt rose over her head and onto the floor next to mine.</p>
<p>I let her seduce me that night for no good reason. Hugo’s words of who I came to be had never been clearer: all Megan saw in me was a lost puppy she could tame for herself—that is what I hated. I fucked her merely because I hated her. I hated how spoiled she was, how there was never any struggle, and how she had never wanted anything in life she couldn’t get.</p>
<p>Still, George’s words to Lucas that day in the café rang in my mind.</p>
