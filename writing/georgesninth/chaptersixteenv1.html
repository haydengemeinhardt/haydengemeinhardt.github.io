<p>Hugo returned on Monday.</p>
<p>He came in black jeans and a black long-sleeve shirt, and the sun was so bright that as it shone in through the window of history class, it nearly sent him back home.</p>
<p>“Why do colors work like this?” Hugo groaned. “It feels like my clothes just came out of the dryer.”</p>
<p>I nearly groaned myself. I hate ordinary days and I wished for unordinary days that offered escapes from the repetition of ordinary ones. Yet, when considering the likely alternatives, it was all I could ask for. The day was of the special kind where it was unordinary for the day to be ordinary. Oh, how delightful a perpetual curse of that would be.</p>
<p>If Megan were to tell anyone about the incident, it would be Hugo. Hugo seemed clueless anything happened at all. Lunch would be a surprise for him, or for me, but in the moment, life was good. I was lucky to always make friends with the right people.</p>
<p>Class went ordinary as well. The past week had been quite odd, as Hugo’s absence had not gone unnoticed. Everyone was ready to hear his comments each class, and without them, the hour would feel longer. But there he was to set us farther behind the other periods of the class.</p>
<p>It was hardly ten minutes into class when it started. Mr. Champi lectured about gladiatorial games and how emperors used them to distract the mass and a student raised their hand. </p>
<p>“I don’t understand how people enjoyed watching other people get torn apart by animals.” </p>
<p>“We are products of our time,” Mr. Champi said.</p>
<p>Hugo raised his hand. “If we are shaped by our time in history, then why study history? Wouldn’t their lessons not apply to us, since we are different?” It sounded like a snarky question, but he didn’t ask it in a snarky way.</p>
<p>“We don’t study history to learn from their mistakes,” Mr. Champi replied. “We study it because it gives us context, meaning, and continuity. It helps us understand why we as a society see the world as we do.”</p>
<p>And then he went on a long rant about the importance of understanding the narrative of mankind as if half of the class cared. They were just relieved that Hugo changed the subject.</p>
<p>At lunch, Hugo joined me at our usual spot while Megan remained with her other friends. Her back was turned to us and not once did she peer over her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Why is she sitting over there?” Hugo asked, biting into his food.</p>
<p>“She is pissed off at me.”</p>
<p>“I’m gone for one week, and you two can’t get along?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what I did,” I said, earnestly. “I only know what I expected her to be upset about, but what she said was something different.”</p>
<p>“She’s dealing with her own problems,” Hugo replied between bites. “What that has to do with you, I don’t know either. But you should know by now that a girl will never tell you directly why she is upset.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true.”</p>
<p>“Is that not what happened?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so. But what should I do then?”</p>
<p>“Eat your lunch,” he said, motioning to the bag of leftovers in front of me, “and give her space. I’ll talk to her.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t have to do that.”</p>
<p>“Sure I do. I don’t want you two breaking us three apart.”</p>
<p>I began twiddling the food out of my bag, thinking of a response I should have thought of earlier. The more I tried to dissuade him, the worse it would get, so I tried changing tactics. “I never meant to drag you into this drama.”</p>
<p>“Whether you intended to or not, she’s over there and you’re over here, and I’m beginning to wonder why I don’t just go over there.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead then,” I insisted, not actually wanting him to leave.</p>
<p>“I’m joking.” Hugo stuffed the last of his sandwich in his mouth. </p>
<p>The wind swiped at my bag, and I imagined it also swept the perspiration off my forehead. The realization settled in that the secret was going to be impossible to hide with time, but that would be a problem for another day. For then, I smiled and relaxed, and popped open the Tupperware of beef and broccoli noodle stir-fry.</p>
<p>Hugo finished gulping his bite. “You seem to be in an oddly good mood,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m eager,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Eager for what?”</p>
<p>“Eager to get out of here and enjoy my evening.”</p>
<p>And so I was. I was going to pick up a guitar today and start learning. I didn’t want to tell Hugo—or anyone, really—until I could at least play a song so as to not give myself the satisfaction of the goal until I actually reached it, which made me all the more eager to pursue it.</p>
<p>There was something inexplicably special about music. There is no experience so stimulating as enjoying a good song, to move in rhythm with existence. And as I had berated Megan about so many dreams being ten minutes a day away, there was no excuse not to partake in the journey.</p>
<p>On my way home from school, I stopped by a music store I knew. Its window displays always allured me when I drove by. Finally standing outside, ready to go in, I was ecstatic. </p>
<p>The door chimed as I entered. An employee from behind the counter looked up at me, while another was too busy helping a customer to the left where woodwinds and brass instruments mounted the wall. Between the door and the counter were a few assembled electric and acoustic drumkits. In a back corner near the counter were different bowed string instruments, and near the windowed front were electric keyboards and a piano. And to the right, the walls were lined with various guitars complimented by large amps underneath.</p>
<p>I walked to the man behind the counter and asked if he knew how to play a guitar.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said, pulling his long hair back. “You looking for acoustic or electric?”</p>
<p>“Acoustic,” I said, “although I don’t know much about them.”</p>
<p>“Is it for you or someone else?”</p>
<p>“For me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, great!” he exclaimed. “Have you ever played a different instrument before?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t really know anything about them.”</p>
<p>“Well, we all started somewhere. I started about your age too, so I know just where you’re at.”</p>
<p>He led me to the guitar section and explained the basics. He pulled one from the shelf and taught me basic chords to try out, then let me play a few of the other guitars. He even insisted I try a few of the higher priced guitars so I could see the difference in price points. I was too naïve to tell, but I nodded anyway.</p>
<p>I left with a beautiful guitar that I spent slightly more on than I was comfortable with. I figured it was part of his job, but he was kind enough that I trusted him and I was excited enough to justify it.</p>
<p>At home, I practiced as long as I could—playing the chords I was taught and following tutorials online. But there comes a time, like running, when my fingers simply could not play on. I assembled the guitar stand that I was given for free, positioned it by the window, and set the guitar in its place. I smiled at having a new addition to my life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the power was still out, and I was craving a cup of coffee, so I grabbed my keys and headed out once more to visit Café Du Mont.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the world’s worst café struck me with nostalgia. Its floors squeaked under my shoes and chairs creaked where people balanced their laptops on wobbly tables. And I nearly forgot about the dim lighting with how the sun lit up the shop. But the most familiar yet strangest thing was the person behind the counter, dressed in full uniform attire and doodling in a notebook.</p>
<p>“Jenny?” I said, walking up to the order counter.</p>
<p>She perked up and immediately pushed her hair behind her ear. “Oh, hey Mickey.”</p>
<p>“You’re working here again?</p>
<p>“Yeah, just started it back up actually.”</p>
<p>“I see. But what about the shop? We’ve been missing you.”</p>
<p>Her shoes squeaked against the floor in uneasiness, as though I asked about her ex on a first date. “It’s just not for me,” she said. “I was only going to take a break, then I realized I wanted to be somewhere a little more familiar.”</p>
<p>“No, I get it.” I waved it off.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you here on your own, though. No Lucas?”</p>
<p>“I have a bunch of homework to catch up on,” I replied. “And I’m just here for a quick cup since a powerline is down near my house.”</p>
<p>She nodded and grabbed a large cup. Then she popped open a sharpie and scribbled on the cup. “That sucks. For what class?”</p>
<p>“Chemistry and pre-calc.”</p>
<p>“I’m not looking forward to those next year,” she said, turning to the machine behind her and positioning the cup under its nozzle. “Maybe you can help me through it.” </p>
<p>“If I get accepted to Valencia and stay here, sure.”</p>
<p>She held a button that let coffee flow from the spout until the cup nearly overflowed, and it probably would have were it not for the few drops that escaped in the steam. “Did you ever finish your applications?”</p>
<p>“Not quite. I haven’t had the motivation. I feel like I’m lame ducking the last few months of high school.”</p>
<p>She slid a heat jacket onto the cup and balanced it to the pickup counter. I followed her around the glass display of delicacies and leaned against the counter as she popped a lid atop the cup.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you grab yourself a cup,” I said, “and come join me at a table?”</p>
<p>She sighed and looked at a table and looked down at the counter and twirled her hair around her finger. “Because I have to work, Mickey Lee,” she said, sliding the cup to me. “And you have homework to do.”</p>
<p>“I think you poured me enough to keep me up all night if I need to.”</p>
<p>“You’re not going to get into Valencia with that attitude.” </p>
<p>She leaned over the counter with her elbows, her lips but a reach away as if to dare me to make a move. I could feel her breath fall upon my skin. </p>
<p>It was easy to resist loving her. Natural, even. I was scared to. The adrenaline faltered me a step back to safety, not to her lips as I wanted. The reality was that she already found someone to pour her heart out to. It would have been wrong to try to kiss her.</p>
<p>“I’ll see you around,” she said.</p>
<p>I handed her my credit card, but she waved it away, so I stuffed it back into my pocket and grabbed my cup. “I’ll see you Jenny.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I reached my car that I noticed my name signed in her perfect handwriting with a small heart dotting the i. Why she had to tug my heart in opposite directions was part of a game I did not understand how to play. I did not understand love. I just knew that I had an undying nerve to pursue it. But the love I had for Jenny and the love I had for Megan were different. The love for Jenny was eloquent and inspired me to embrace the comfort of life and hope—a lust that was forbidden of me—while the love I had for Megan was ardent and impulsive and left the rest of life bland in its wake yet was equally dangerous because I did not know how to navigate it.</p>
<p>For a path to be unknown and dangerous meant it to be avoided, and a path comfortable and explored to be followed, if one’s goal is to reach a destination. It was a decision so trite that it wasn’t typically a decision at all. With its incessant coaxing, anyone else would say that the inclination made it right. What else were the purposes of inclinations? Yet I knew not the destination I wanted, only the destination I wanted to avoid, and it was that along the one path that I knew monotony and complacency sprung like weeds in a garden. </p>
<p>If I was to take the other path, I had to make things right with Megan. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be taking that path at all—I would simply be taking a variation of the complacent route. </p>
<p>Megan’s house wasn’t far from Café du Mont, which meant there was no excuse to settle for a drawn out text message. So by the time the coffee was cool enough to drink, I was parked along the road outside Megan’s house.</p>
<p>I climbed the steps to her front door and rang the bell. As I waited for whoever inside to cross the house and reach the door, I repeated phrases aloud. Soon, the phrases became more scripted than natural, and while Megan’s house was very large, it did not take that long to answer the door. I peered in the window and saw nothing. No one was home.</p>
<p>I headed to my car in disappointment. Perhaps Megan was not the one for me either. At least I tried.</p>
<p>I looked up and down the road and saw it to be lifeless, and it was like a hook clipped the collar of my shirt and was being reeled back toward the house. I halted, then followed silently, without thought, for I knew what thought would say.</p>
<p>I trekked around the side of the house and unlatched the gate, allowing myself into the backyard. I continued to the backdoor and grasped its latch. It clicked open. I let myself in.</p>
<p>The house was as beautiful as I remembered it from my time at her parties, but I only ever went so far as the bathroom which was within eyesight. Continuing around corners and down hallways revealed so much more, and the strange decorative flow of water in the bathroom made sense. Amongst the walls and rooms and even the floors—everywhere a water feature could be snuck in, it was. The art was built into the house itself, like one monumental masterpiece. </p>
<p>But the water was absent where it usually flowed and still where it rested. I only heard one source of moving water. Following the sound, I entered a grand living room where a flat waterfall stretched twenty feet down against a black slab of rock and landed atop a large fireplace. On the mantle of the fireplace was an arrangement of awards—not flashy trophies one gets in sports but those glass ones with opaque inscriptions. Even as I approached them and stood but a couple of feet away, I could not discern the writing.</p>
<p>To my left was a wall of framed newspaper and magazine articles. From a distance, I only assumed they were of the moon landing, Dewey defeating Truman, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, or other historical events. But as I got closer, I realized they weren’t historical events at all. They were simply article after article of the Grayson company, appended with picture after picture of the man I saw at the Grand Plaza and at the speech at school, and next to him in many stood Megan, putting on a grandiose smile.</p>
<p>I let out an audible “oh”. The thought hadn’t even crossed my mind, but indeed Megan’s last name was Grayson, and while the area was full of rich kids, her house was larger than most.</p>
<p>The numerous water features around the living room sprung to life. All around me were fountains and spouts and cascades, plentiful and beautiful yet not overwhelming but comforting in a way that made the ostentatious room feel more home than my own.</p>
<p>A door down the hallway slammed shut. Before I could trek across the living room into hiding, Darius Grayson appeared at its entrance. He stood in a suit with a coat and tie draped over his arm. Behind his rectangular-framed glasses, his eyes were heavy with fatigue, yet perplexed at my standing in his living room.</p>
<p>“Ah, Mr. Grayson,” I greeted, calmly in hopes he would remain calm too.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” he asked, but not angrily.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m Megan’s friend. I’m just waiting on her to grab something from her room.”</p>
<p>“Is that your car out front?”</p>
<p>I scratched the back of my head. “Uh, yeah. You know how she is about driving.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.” He hung his coat from a rack on the wall.</p>
<p>“She doesn’t like to drive in the rain.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not raining?”</p>
<p>“It’s forecasted to later tonight,” I bluffed. “Low chance. Maybe, maybe not. But how don’t you know when Megan drives or takes the bus?”</p>
<p>He shrugged. “I usually leave for work by then.” He walked over to me near the wall of articles, scanning them with a bored interest.</p>
<p>“Why do you drag Megan into these photos?” The question daringly sprung from my lips without thought.</p>
<p>“I don’t. She’s there on her own terms, because she’ll be inheriting the company one day and will need to be known.” After a moment, he added, “Why do you ask? Has she said something about them?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” I said. But it was exactly nothing being said that was the problem, and he didn’t even flinch, as though he was blind to the actual meaning of the answer. </p>
<p>“Has she been acting okay at school?” he persisted. “Nothing wrong?”</p>
<p>“Not really,” I lied, as desperate for an answer as him. “Although, I have another question. Is Megan why you fund that program at school?”</p>
<p>“She’s why I started years ago,” he said, turning away to face the living room, “but my daughter has not been herself lately and I want to find out why.”</p>
<p>In the answer that had nothing to do with my question, I immediately understood.</p>
<p>Megan had separated her last name so far from her life that I hadn’t even known the connection. I hadn’t known about her dad or why she wasn’t going to college or the company she was bound to start taking on after school without question. Her father laid out a life for her that she did not want. From her perspective, she was just a tool in his game, and she felt she could not say no. Meanwhile her father thought it was the greatest gift a father could bestow to his daughter, because money was the greatest value in our society.</p>
<p>Grayson was all she had ever been. Not Megan, but Megan Grayson, daughter of the affluent Darius Grayson. All people saw in her was the next rich girl in town, like all people saw in me was the depressed kid upset about his friend’s death, when in reality neither of us wanted those attributes.</p>
<p>“Do you know of any bullying or…” Darius waved his hand in the air as if it would contrive his words for him. It was sad, really, how out of touch he was.</p>
<p>“Look behind you,” I blurted, sticking my hand out in frustration. “What do you see in those pictures?”</p>
<p>Darius was taken aback for a moment, then fixed his glasses and gazed inside the frames adorning the wall.</p>
<p>I almost wanted to let him figure it out for himself, but I feared if he hadn’t connected the dots yet, it’d be too late once he had. My concerns weren’t for him anyway. It was for Megan. “Do you not see the eyes of a girl who has no desire to be there?”</p>
<p>His eyebrows creased together as though the thought had never entered his mind. I knew, because it was the same crease of the brows that my father had when I asked if he thought I was spoiled. </p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” he said, “but I got work to do. I hope you two enjoy your night together.” Then he turned and walked down the nearest hallway, leaving the room with me and the lively water features behind.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>There was no thrill in entering Megan’s house, but after leaving it, I needed one. I needed a thrill not for distraction from depression or disappointment—as I suspiciously had none after leaving Megan’s house—but for distraction from how uneventful life was becoming.</p>
<p>It was more eventful than ever, actually, but somehow the events became dreadfully insignificant and pointless. To a fifteen year old first driving a car on a highway, it is adrenaline inducing and freeing. By the time you hit seventeen, it becomes a chore. Much like the first time I entered someone’s house, it made me squint in the mirror. Now, sneaking around was a mere formality. </p>
<p>The scale with which the events impacted me became diluted with familiarity. The honeymoon phase only lasts so long, and it was my longing wish that it never ended. Maybe that was the same for my wish of a long life, that I was simply young and in its honeymoon phase, and that my only purpose was to enjoy it while it lasted.</p>
<p>That was the problem. I couldn’t enjoy life when everything was pointless relative to the delusional dream I had of living forever to find a means to become one step above consciousness, to find out what an endless paradise was other than endlessly drugging our brains on happiness of which we could achieve here on Earth just fine.</p>
<p>Thus to avoid a crisis, I thought to thrust myself into a house that was not empty. It was dark and after dinner, and the first house I found with an unlocked back door, hopping from backyard to backyard, I slid myself into.</p>
<p>Closing the door behind me, I found myself in a kitchen. A family chattered away in an adjacent living room, laughing about how their niece did this or nephew did that or something. I couldn’t really tell. I didn’t really care. As long as there wasn’t a moment of awkward silence or the dad’s flatulence that would send everyone running to the other rooms, I would be fine.</p>
<p>Then I sensed that I wasn’t the only one in the room. A large black figure walked on all fours in front of me, growling quietly and ready to pounce. Gnashing its teeth.</p>
<p>Damn it, I couldn’t find myself leaving right after I got inside. But what was I to do?</p>
<p>The family laughed and laughed, and finally a little girl asked, “where’s Molly?”</p>
<p>The dog’s ears perked.</p>
<p>“Yeah, where is Molly?” another voice asked. Suddenly, they all started calling for Molly.</p>
<p>A hand reached for the light switch. I dove below the table where a long cloth hung to the bottom of the seats positioned around, in view from the doorway. An in the moment rookie mistake.</p>
<p>A black dress drooped just below the little girl's knees in the doorway. Next to the leather couches behind her, where the family turned toward the kitchen, a small, empty, reinflating beanbag chair lied on the floor, with me insight of anyone who sat in it.</p>
<p>“Molly, what are you doing in here?” the girl's soft voice chirped.</p>
<p>Molly rose her back two legs and walked toward the girl who lead the dog back into the living room. The girl had left the light on. I had to move before she sat down and saw me hiding, but the family was still looking at Molly and the little girl.</p>
<p>Her body turned around to fall into the chair and I dove for the kitchen island, careful not to make a sound.</p>
<p>Without pause they went back to talking as the father excused himself to use the restroom.</p>
<p>The world depraved itself of oxygen as I struggled to silence my breathing at the speed my heart was racing. The ceramic tiles chilled my lower spine as my forehead began to dampen. I tilted my head to the ceiling, my back leaning against the island, and smiled. I felt alive again. </p>
<p>Sneaking into empty homes felt like a cheap trick. Why slyly shuffle cards when you can disappear?</p>
<p>The hardwood of the stairs softly creaked with every other step as I edged up to a tenebrous hallway, where silver light illuminated a small section of carpeted floor through an open door on the right. As I turned into the room, a gentle breeze caught my shirt, and an array of stars spun around the pink ceiling from a spherical nightlight at the bed-side table of a bed that was too small for a grown adult. The branches of the tall front yard oak tree rustled against the top half of the open window and another breeze of howling, chilling wind rushed through the bottom.</p>
<p>I pushed the window down into its crevice. As the room fell silent, I felt a pair of eyes fall upon me. I jerked around to see a man holding a silver magnum pointed at my body with the sneering, growling, four legged behemoth at his side.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're just a kid," he mumbled, half lowering the gun before snapping it back up. "Why are you going through my daughter's room?"</p>
<p>I shook my head with my hands raised. "It's not like that at all. The window was open…"</p>
<p>He turned to flip the light switch and I sprung, pushing him to the ground and running down the stairs two at a time with the thuds of my shoes slamming into the creaks of boards. The family streamed into the kitchen in disarray, blocking the back door from which I entered. I snaked towards the front and ran into the garage. I hit the button and as the door groaned up, I rolled under and sprinted into hiding in the neighbor’s bushes before anyone could see.</p>
<p>Between the branches I could see the dad run out, turn up and down and up and down the street, then swing about back inside swearing up a flurry of condensed breath.</p>
<p>I clung the small ceramic mug I snagged on my way out, hoping for some sort of thrill, but there was none. Only the chase left me barely excited. The cup meant nothing, and much like a special day, once it was ruined by some terrible accident it was ruined forever.</p>
<p>I pushed the branches aside and set the cup in the family's mailbox. They probably wouldn't even know it was gone and toss it thinking I had done some godforsaken act with it. It was a waste of a perfectly good cup, a waste of a family's sense of a security, and a waste of thrill.</p>
<p>The only thrill in stealing now was getting caught.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I reclined in the backyard of my own home. A fire crackled in a firepit. Stars sprinkled the sky. The world was well asleep. Far, far asleep in its dogmatic slumber.</p>
<p>I tracked the moon as it crawled across the night sky, taking a small sip of whiskey from a frosted decanter each time the blinking light of a plane hurried across its face. Two if I could see the trail of pollution it left behind distorting the craters. And three if I felt like it.</p>
<p>My father told me that when I was a kid, I didn’t believe the sun or the moon moved in the sky, but rather jumped from place to place whenever I looked, like the hour hand on a clock. It was too slow of a movement to catch in a quick glimpse, yet I was too impatient to wait it out.</p>
<p>I was a very skeptical child to say the least. Always untrusting of the world against me as though I was expecting it to throw the first punch. Not like it was ever my friend or on my side. Sometimes that skepticism was mistaken for stubbornism but I could hardly tell the difference myself. </p>
<p>When I grew up and realized everything they told me that I was skeptical about was actually true—except Santa or when they’d tell me I was the most talented kid they’d ever seen—I became doubtless about what people would tell me. How was I to be skeptical when I was too naive to know any better? Maybe I was skeptical at too young an age, but it seemed like a naive way to avoid explanations I didn’t like, so I blindly believed what was said.</p>
<p>When I reached the age where people learned how to strategically lie to get ahead in life, I just accepted I had no idea what life had in store for me. The only way to know the truth was to find it for myself.</p>
<p>“Since when do you drink whiskey?” my father asked as he settled onto a chair next to me, groggy-eyed in pajama shorts and a white t shirt. “And don’t you think two in the morning might be a little late for that?”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t sleep.”</p>
<p>He nodded and rubbed his eyes. “One of those nights?”</p>
<p>“One of those nights.” I circled the remaining fragments of ice in my glass.</p>
<p>“Not going to bed soon?”</p>
<p>“Not going to bed soon.”</p>
<p>“Well, what’s on your mind?” he asked, as though he thought he was Bobby. Or that he wished he could take Bobby’s place for him and answer my questions.</p>
<p>“Don’t you need to get some sleep of your own?”</p>
<p>“I actually have to go in a little early today,” he said, “but if there’s anything you need, I’ll always be here to provide it.”</p>
<p>“You couldn’t even keep Mom around,” I mumbled, “and now can’t afford the mortgage.” I don’t know what made those words come out of my mouth. We rarely talked about it, and he had lived an embittered life since then. In the moment, I thought maybe a blunt convocation would get him to open up to me. But all I had done was slapped him across the face and expected him to subsequently divulge a life story. “Sorry, I didn’t—”</p>
<p>“No, you’re right. I was never the money maker in the family, and I knew that would forever be the case when I married her. But she didn’t leave for money like you may think.”</p>
<p>I had sat there for hours watching the moon circle the sky to prove what I once thought was a lie to be true, but I had thought for weeks what would cause her to opt for such an odious method of dealing with a dispute, and nothing made more sense than the greed for the beloved corruption of obscene wealth. “Then why did she leave?”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to get into it right now.” He took a deep breath, a sign that he needed to remove himself from the situation. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I just have a lot on my plate.”</p>
<p>“Nothing I can help with?”</p>
<p>He doesn’t know about the thrills I get in life. No one does other than Megan, as far as I know. It’s not something you talk about, like a cheating spouse doesn’t talk about it with her family, and consequently, never gets addressed. It becomes a second life. But what happens when those two lives collide? When an officer knocks on the door and tears down the façade I have put up, to not only make my father wonder who I truly am, but make him wonder who he truly is and what kind of father he is to raise a son he is so blind to? He would still love me, though grow to hate himself even more than when he lost a wife he was equally as blind to.</p>
<p>“Nothing you can help with,” I replied.</p>
