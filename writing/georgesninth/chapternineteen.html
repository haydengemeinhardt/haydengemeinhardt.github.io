<p>A pounding on the bathroom door forced me awake. </p>
<p>“Newport police, open up!”</p>
<p>I jumped from the cold bath, drenching the floor with a wave of water. I paused the music on my phone and stretched my clothes as I forced them on my wet body. How was I so careless? Pure habit locked the door, but it only bought me time insofar as the owners wanted to hold off repairs—</p>
<p>The police banged again. “This is your last warning!”</p>
<p>—which apparently wasn’t long. My only escape was a large frosted window just above the bathtub, sealed into the wall with no mechanism to open. I didn’t want to damage their home. I just couldn’t bring myself to give up. I scanned the room for a heavy object, then grabbed the ceramic lid of the toilet tank and launched it at the window. The window shattered. The lid fractured. Chips and chunks of ceramic ricocheted back at me, peppering my clothes with small bits. A large piece scratched and bruised my cheek. </p>
<p>White dust lingered in the opening like fog. The light that tried to penetrate into the outside reflected off of the dust, shrouding the view. The police kicked at the door and nearly broke it free. I slipped on my untied shoes and grabbed my gym bag. Another kick flung the door open. I climbed through the hole, cutting myself on glass that remained stuck in the frame, and jumped onto the ground. Broken bits of glass and ceramic littering the ground crunched under my shoes. I lunged a few steps from the window, then kicked off my shoes and ran with them in hand. The police climbed through the window after me, but by then it was too late; I was Mickey Lee. With George gone, no one in all of Newport could catch me. The flashlights stretched as far as they could to reach my back and casted a quickly fading mold of myself in front of me. One of the officers turned around and raced for their car while the other kept their pursuit. </p>
<p>I cut in between houses before the street lit up with blue and red. I knew the area better than those who lived there. I knew almost instinctively where to go—I ran the roads year after year, mapping every home, yard, tree, hill, and park with nothing more to think about than which gaps and routes would be best to escape a pursuit by foot. The police had chased me many times on that road before. The difference was the police and the consequences were real.</p>
<p>I ran between unfenced yards, across small streams and ditches, and through wooded areas that had lost their prickly undergrowth in the cold. The gap stretched far. They were long out of my sight. The more confident I was in having escaped, the more I slowed until I stopped behind a wall to catch my breath and put on my shoes. </p>
<p>I took a long detour through parks, unfenced yards, and the edges of lakes and rivers, and the parts I ran in the open I ran with my head on a swivel. When I arrived home, I entered through the back. How sickly ironic was it to sneak into my own home? I didn’t want Dad to see me coming home from a run in torn clothes and my car missing from the driveway. Too many questions. I bet Megan wouldn’t even know the answer to those.</p>
<p>—--------</p>
<p>Dad left in the morning without waking me upstairs. With my car gone, he probably assumed I had stayed somewhere else for the night, which was fair given how cold it was inside. I needed to get my car back though, and the first thing on the agenda that morning was to retrieve it. I left shortly after he had—as early in the morning as I could manage—to blend in with the early morning joggers and then drive away before the cops would return for further investigation. </p>
<p>The fog was light. Morning dew coated the off-green grass and dead leaves, delivering a faint freshness to the cool air. The streets were quiet as traffic was contained to the main roads, bar the chirping of birds and honking of geese, and the trickle of cars sweeping by on their way out of the neighborhoods. I could’ve counted on one hand the number of times I had run in the morning. There was something refreshing about it. Half a mile into the run, my body was warm and awake, and the sweat cleansed my skin. But the excitement of an evening run, the catharsis of the stress of the day, was still better than a bright morning.</p>
<p>I arrived at the house before morning rush hour ended. Much to my relief, my car was left untouched. I drove home with it in confidence that the incident was behind me. Yet when I got home, the burden of Jenny remained, and there was no way I could’ve focused at school with her on my mind. Even if I did go to school, I wouldn’t find her there. And if I went hospital to hospital in search of her, I wouldn’t be allowed to see her without her family. My only option was to wait until her parents were off work then try to catch them. </p>
<p>I laid in bed and tried to go back to sleep. Hours passed before I could. I didn’t set an alarm thinking I’d wake plenty early, but I woke well past the time I should’ve. The evening rush hour was already over. Jenny’s parents were finished with work, and if they went home first, they would’ve left at any moment. I sprung from my bed, grabbed my keys, and rushed out the door, praying I could catch them.</p>
<p>The late fall sun fell before I reached the Lebedev household. Hope returned in the form of light from their windows. Silhouettes danced in the curls of the curtains, morphing the characters behind them, while shouting permeated through the glass trying to tell the story. It was like watching a dramatic play from the back row of a vast theater, where one could hardly hear or see the actors on stage. But with George and Jenny removed, the house felt unfamiliar and empty. Not vacant, but not full, like a liminal mall that hadn't shut down despite its anchors bankrupt. Still, the actors rehearsed on stage in the empty theater, unaware I was hiding in the back—standing in the grass with my ear close to the living room window.</p>
<p>“How can they deny the claim?” Mr. Lebedev’s deep voice struck through the glass. “Why do they always have to be such a pain in the ass!”</p>
<p>“I’ll call tomorrow, alright?” Mrs. Lebedeva yelled back. “You’re always losing your mind over unimportant things!”</p>
<p>“This is thousands of dollars!”</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll just have to deal with it!”</p>
<p>An approaching car blasted music, muffling the argument while traveling at neighborhood speeds. I cursed under my breath and rushed to the front door in case they saw me.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lebedeva’s voice reemerged after they passed, loud enough to hear without moving back, “it’s not like you were home often enough to know anyway!”</p>
<p>“Because I was working to cover bills like this!” Mr. Lebedev yelled. Ceramic crashed against the floor.</p>
<p>As convenient as the yelling was for me to be able to hear them, I wished they were in less aggressive of a mood. I never knew them to dislike each other. Yet there they were, transformed under pressure. Who could blame them? The situation wasn’t going to improve, so I daintily chimed the doorbell. The fighting ceased as the ring faded, and their silhouettes froze in the curtains, staring at the entrance. One moved my way.</p>
<p>Mr. Lebedev opened the door slightly, such that he could soon close it. He looked at me with a blank face. His dress shirt was half untucked from his black pants and his tie was half loosened, as though a bill left on the sideboard interrupted his undoing of it. Despite his drained appearance, he stiffened his posture after realizing it was me, Mickey Lee. He fully opened the door and leaned one hand against the frame while stuffing the other into his pocket. Mrs. Lebedeva appeared behind him, trying to discretely kick away a piece of plate despite it clattering on the floor. She pushed him aside after seeing me. </p>
<p>“Mickey, it’s been so long since we’ve seen you!” Mrs. Lebedeva said. “How are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I’m okay,” I said, cupping the back of my neck. “I heard about what happened. With Jenny. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. It’s been quite difficult.” She lifted her hand to Mr. Lebedev’s back and looked at him, waiting for a glance of agreement. He nodded and replied, “It has been.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lebedeva turned back to me and frowned, “I know you and Jenny were starting to talk a lot, at work and school. It must be hard for you as well.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I’m happy she’s okay,” I said, unsure of how true that really was. “Actually, I was wondering—”</p>
<p>“Were you here yesterday?” Mr. Lebedev interrupted.</p>
<p>A wave of heat passed over my face. Why did the body have to be so telling? I lifted my eyebrows and tilted my head, pretending to be confused. “No? Why?”</p>
<p>He lifted his finger, then paused and shook his head. “Nevermind.”</p>
<p>I cleared my throat. “Anyway, I was wondering if I could see Jenny.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lebedeva smiled and touched my shoulder, rubbing her thumb against it. Mr. Lebedev frowned, likely wondering how far I was going to shove myself into their family affairs.</p>
<p>“We were about to visit her,” Mrs. Lebedeva said, turning to Mr. Lebedev. “Or at least, I was, if you need to go to bed, honey.”</p>
<p>“I could stay up all night, honey,” he returned. “Although, I don’t think the hospital will allow Mickey to see her.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” Mrs. Lebedeva said. “We can give him permission.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think they allow that either.” He turned back to me. “I wouldn’t want you to go all the way up there only to be turned away. I think it’s best for you to wait until she’s better.”</p>
<p>“If they turn me away, that’s fine,” I said. “I wasn’t going to stay long anyway. I just want to see how she’s doing.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s try,” Mrs. Lebedeva said, snagging the decision. “Give us a couple of minutes to get ready and you can follow us there.”</p>
<p>—-----</p>
<p>Mr. Lebedev wasn’t always irritable—with a family name like his, he couldn’t afford to be. In fact, it was the first time I had seen him as frustrated since George totaled his car. The cost wasn’t what angered him despite that being what he had directed his anger towards. George nearly throwing his life away angered him. Tossing it to the wind, not holding it dear enough. He was mad for no other reason than selfish love for his son.</p>
<p>The couple bickered at each other down the hallway with me in tow, continuing on from what must’ve been a quarrelsome drive. We were a spotlight among others who confined themselves to chairs periodically lining the walls. Those that had been there for a while were half asleep with styrofoam cups of cold coffee and wads of wrappers from nearby vending machines littering adjacent tables. The local news in the background tried to fill the awkward hush, but no one turned to the news to feel better about the world—they could go outside for that—and so the news never said anything worth smiling about. It at least fit the atmosphere, as opposed to chirpy mall music, or blindingly bright white lights built into the ceiling tiles paired with a pungent smell of disinfectant.</p>
<p>The Lebedevs ceased arguing as they approached a counter to get directed to Jenny’s room. The nurse staffing the counter asked for their drivers licenses. </p>
<p>“Only two visitors are allowed at a time,” she said, eyeballing me digging for my own from between their shoulders.</p>
<p>Jenny’s parents twisted around in confusion, like I was a pest they forgot about amongst their dispute.</p>
<p>“Are you serious?” I spat</p>
<p>“It’s for the patient’s well being,” the nurse said.</p>
<p>“I tried to tell you,” Mr. Lebedev said.</p>
<p>I nearly stirred so much commotion in the hall that she’d regret having said anything, just to confute that smug face of Mr. Lebedev’s otherwise, until I realized placing myself in the midst of family affairs like that would probably be unsalvageable anyway. Instead, it became an opportunity to see Jenny alone. </p>
<p>“Just give me ten minutes,” I said, “then I’ll leave.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lebedev sighed and looked at the time on his phone, hoping I would go away by expression alone, or that Mrs. Lebedeva would be the one to turn me away since she was the one who invited me, but she waited for him.</p>
<p>“Five,” he said. “You have five minutes.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Lebedeva nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Five minutes alone with Jenny. What a deal!</p>
<p>On my way to Jenny’s room, after getting my pass, I stopped in a small side room with vending and coffee machines. I hurriedly emptied my wallet of ones and punched in an order. As the machine churned, I peered back down the hallway at the Lebedevs, who continued bickering off to the side in a hushed voice. The snack crinkled as it landed in the delivery bin. I grabbed it from the slot and turned to leave. I froze in my steps. A security guard was sitting outside in the hallway, pecking away at his phone. The guard looked up. We locked eyes. We smiled. I made my exit. Room 6035 was two more rooms down the hallway. Time was ticking.</p>
<p>I stopped outside Jenny’s room and took a deep breath. The last time I talked to her, I told her she didn’t matter anymore with no explanation. I didn’t think she’d understand. There I was standing outside, hoping she’d understand an even more complicated explanation as to why she should forgive me, despite the consequences having already been felt.</p>
<p>The hall was quiet, but the room was silent. In all other aspects, the room was simply a wider and slightly dimmer hall with more strategically placed equipment and a dead end at a wall of glass. Six stories was not high up, but it was high enough to peek over the strips of the buildings until the city’s bright bubble of light faded into the dark behind distant trees. Jenny was sitting at a small desk with her back to me, portraited by the view, immersed in a show on her laptop.</p>
<p>I gently closed the door, twisting the handle as if she was asleep. I sauntered toward her, past the white bed against white floors and white walls, and set the pack of Oreos on the gray desk at her side.</p>
<p>Jenny jumped in her chair. She looked at the Oreos, looked up at me, and frowned. She paused her show and took out an earbud with a small oxygen monitor on her finger. “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“To visit you,” I said. “And see how you’re doing.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m fine,” she said, pushing back her hair.</p>
<p>“Has anyone else visited you yet?”</p>
<p>“Just my parents. I’m only in here until the morning, and I didn’t think anyone else knew. How did you know?”</p>
<p>“I went to your house to apologize, and your parents told me what happened,” I lied.</p>
<p>“I told them not to tell anyone.” She put her hand to her face. “Oh God, please don’t tell me everyone knows!”</p>
<p>“You want to keep it a secret?”</p>
<p>“This was an accident. Being here is embarrassing. Of course I want to keep it a secret. I don’t even want to talk about it.”</p>
<p>“We don’t have to talk about it. But no one would look down on you for this. Things happen.” I sat on the couch in line with the desk, pushed back against the window and facing the room. A clock was positioned next to a small TV in front of the bed. People passing by the door cast shadows in the crevice beneath it.</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid,” Jenny said. “You don’t think people are going to draw conclusions?”</p>
<p>“What conclusions?”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“I heard something happened with you and Margaret. Is it something with that?”</p>
<p>“Of course it is! I stuck my neck out for you, then you spat in my face. Does that ring a bell?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>She stared at me with astonishment, until it dawned on her that I was clueless. “Wow, you really don’t know anything, do you?” she hissed. “How can you be a part of so many things and not know?” She slammed shut her laptop and tossed her other earbud on the desk. “You made one of Margaret’s friends upset, so she bitched about you at lunch. I defended you. I was the only one. Then she took pictures of us at the cafe and in the parking lot and convinced everyone I was cheating with you before breaking up with Antonio. And guess what? Antonio’s her best friend and believed every bit, so that’s what he tells everyone happened.”</p>
<p>I shifted in my seat, shocked by the news. “I wish you would’ve told me about all of this before.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and scoffed, “I thought you knew.”</p>
<p>“This must’ve all happened, what, Friday? And yesterday? I don’t think it’s fair you expected that of me.”</p>
<p>“It started Tuesday last week,” she said. “Have you not talked to anyone since? I don’t know how else you wouldn’t have known.”</p>
<p>“Pretty much,” I said. “I was in my head. But I don’t talk to your friend group anyway, you know that. Also, the whole cheating accusation seems so unlike you I don’t see how people would believe in it enough to spread it. It’s a completely out of proportion response. Was there something going on between you and Margaret before?”</p>
<p>The tension in Jenny’s body eased. “A few small things, but it was mainly me breaking up with her best friend.”</p>
<p>“If not with her or Antonio, someone else?”</p>
<p>She shook her head and looked out the window like she was thinking.</p>
<p>I glanced at the clock. It had already been four minutes. I’d stay up all night with her if I could, but her parents were, rightfully, itching to kick me out. They wouldn’t kick me out so quickly though, no matter what we agreed to.</p>
<p>“Do you know what they said about you?” Jenny asked. </p>
<p>I darted my eyes back to her. “No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“They said you’re a thief. That you hate people that are better than you and steal their things. I couldn’t believe that. I called them liars.”</p>
<p>I pulled back. “A thief? I never stole anything! They are liars,” I proclaimed as truthfully as anxiously. “Do people really believe that? Where is it coming from?”</p>
<p>“Only as much as they want to. And I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Where else would it have come from but Megan? Jenny said it was Tuesday last week, the day after I tried to open up to Megan. Did Megan misunderstand, or was it twisted somewhere along the line? I didn’t have time to go into it, so I downplayed it. “Well, back when we first started working at the shop, I did steal gum from some of the nicer cars. I didn’t think it was from anyone we knew. Maybe it was.”</p>
<p>“That’s cute,” she replied. “Everyone stole gum.”</p>
<p>I tilted my head. “Wait, you did that too? I didn’t take you for a petty thief like me.”</p>
<p>“Only after lunch,” she smirked. “It hits different than buying it yourself.” She collected her earbuds and tucked them away in their case. She rose and joined me on the other seat of the couch, tucking one leg under the other to face me and hiding her oxygen monitor with her other hand. “Even though I didn’t believe them, in the back of my mind, I wondered if the rumor was true. They were close to me, after all. But after they blatantly lied about me, and about us, I no longer doubted they lied about you. Honestly, I think they were making things up about you to get at me.” She looked down and picked at the seams of the couch. “They can be ridiculous sometimes. I’m sorry you were dragged into it. I just wish you hadn’t piled on though, that really hurt.” </p>
<p>I sighed. “That’s what I came to talk to you about.”</p>
<p>“I know,” she said.</p>
<p>“Jenny, I really am sorry about what I did.”</p>
<p>Jenny let my obvious words float in silence, and continued picking at the seams. The air grew heavy. “I don’t doubt that you are,” she said, “I just don’t know if I could forget.” She buried her face in her hands. “But I wonder, who else am I supposed to go to?”</p>
<p>The words struck deep. Consequences always did. “I don’t want that to be the reason you talk to me,” I said. “I was in my head and acted very nasty towards you. I’m not asking for you to forget or pretend it affected you less than it did, but I want us to at least connect on this for a moment. Did we ever deserve to be friends with each other?“</p>
<p>“I acted mean?”</p>
<p>“We both did. We both pushed each other away. And for the same reasons.” I took out my phone and began scrolling to near the start of our text history. “I’m not holding this against you, but do you remember when I first texted you after work? I was trying to figure out why you were so upset, and you said you were dealing with thoughts and wanted space.” I arrived at the texts and slid shoulder-to-shoulder with her to point them out.</p>
<p>“I totally forgot about that,” she said, staring at the screen as I slowly scrolled through the texts.</p>
<p>After the point was made, I put my phone away. “I’m not mad or upset about it. You asked me to understand you, so now I’m hoping you can understand me.”</p>
<p>“Mickey, it’s not that I don’t understand. I could tell you were having a hard time. It’s that I don’t know if I can take it like you did. Part of what I loved about you is that you kept reaching out despite me closing up. I tried to do the same for you, but I made the mistake of asking for more than your friendship. I poured my heart out to you. You didn’t kindly say you weren’t interested. You begged me to never speak to you again. With everything that happened in my life, with my friends and my relationship, how do you think that made me feel?”</p>
<p>I looked to the floor in desperation. Time was ticking and nothing was going as I hoped. “I don’t know what you want me to say,” I said.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you want me to say either.” She shrugged. “You’re the one that came here.”</p>
<p>She understood that I hurt her because I was struggling. Would giving her a deeper understanding of why I spat in her face help? Almost every criminal could genuinely voice the courtroom their regret, but that did not justify a pardon. They would be free to do it again, learning from their mistake to be more careful. As I realized with Megan, even if I had the supernatural ability to convey all that was lingering in me, and the perspective of which to see it through, it merely made for interesting conversation. Not forgiveness, not trust, not something different. After all, what would stop me from spitting in her face again? And why should she change herself because of my past?</p>
<p>I rather needed Jenny to understand that I regretted what I did—not because I faced consequences and wanted to return to the old status quo, but because I changed into a different, hopefully better person who still loved her despite becoming someone else entirely—and wanted something new. All else was up to her. I could only hope that when she looked at me, she wouldn’t see me impossibly hoping she’d pretend it never happened, and that she’d want something new too.</p>
<p>“I was jealous of you and George,” I blurted, then paused, realizing I anxiously spoke too soon despite the silence we had been sitting in.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry?” Jenny asked.</p>
<p>“It’s a long story,” I warned.</p>
<p>“Tell me,” she said.</p>
<p>“During the summer,” I continued, shaking my head, “I was obsessed with finding a story. The reason being, life was demanding of me to start providing reasons for what I wanted to do, and I had none to give. Of course, a story never materialized. Time passed by regardless. But George constantly had bad things happen to him—many things that you shared—which, as awful as they were, imbued his days with meaning and his spirit with reasons to strive. As I ran alongside him, I shamefully wished I were a part of something that’d make me as resolved. However, I was lonely with that wish. How could I claim in front of someone who was struggling that their struggle was a gift? And how could I criticize someone who was content with not struggling? I was clearly missing something.</p>
<p>“So I dug and dug into myself. Only, the more I searched, the less I understood. The obvious aspects of life became non-obvious and overwhelming. Death itself transformed into this inevitable, endless void lurking closer with each hour. It was so immense that it was like looking up at the night sky, with the illusion that it seems you could climb a mountain and grab a handful of fabric even though it’s a lifetime away. Yet it was so terrifying that it was like watching it quickly collapsing inward. I couldn’t take it.</p>
<p>“Every time I looked at you, I was reminded. But you reminded me for reasons that weren’t your fault. See, I never got to know you as well as I would’ve liked. In place of that, my mind projected the same myth upon you that I had projected onto George. It filled in the missing pieces and tricked me into thinking I already knew you. When I realized that I had subconsciously infested you with that myth, it faded, and the parts that were actually you remained. The parts that I actually grew to care about. You became someone that I had always cared for but never fully knew. Only, I had already pushed you away. I’m sorry. I really am. I–”</p>
<p>I sighed. My heart raced. My face grew warm. I laughed and hesitated, looking away.</p>
<p>Jenny caught on, but pretended she hadn’t. “What?”</p>
<p>“I care for you so much more than I thought I could. In ways I can’t deny. The impossibility of letting you go made me realize that the void didn’t dwarf everything, it amplified everything. You changed my perspective on life, not the other way around. I don’t just care for you. I love you.”</p>
<p>She let her hair fall down and shield her face. “Slow down. You’re saying too much.”</p>
<p>I checked the clock again. It had been nearly fifteen minutes. I couldn’t imagine I’d be able to stay any longer. “I can’t slow down,” I said. “I’ve done enough of that in my life, and look where it got me.” I grabbed her hand. She didn’t pull back, so I dropped her hand and wrapped my arms around her. After a couple of moments that felt much longer than they actually were, her arms wrapped around my back and pulled me close. She smiled against my neck.</p>
<p>I drew back, tipped her chin, and kissed her trembling lips.</p>
<p>A knock made us push away from each other. Shadows stood blocking the light under the gap of the door. That was okay, I thought. I wouldn’t lose her. I’d see her the next day, and in a better setting. I could hardly hide my excitement as the door opened. But when I turned expecting her parents, there were instead three officers staring me down, including the one from the hallway who had obviously been waiting there for someone like me to pass by.</p>
<p>Life had caught up to me. I sprang to my feet, and the officers poised ready to stop me. Jenny’s expression turned from confusion to a horrifying realization.</p>
<p>“Was it you?” she asked.</p>
