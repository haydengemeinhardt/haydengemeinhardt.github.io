<p>Having recently read Descartes’ “Discourse On Method”, I was excited to read “Meditations on First Philosophy” in which he builds off of his previous work and presents it for the general public.</p>
<p>Descartes is brilliant to a fault. Not only is his name is in the basis of disciplines from mathematics to philosophy, but he tends to push his ideas further than they can really go. It isn’t inherently a terrible trait; however, it does garner a lot of criticism.</p>
<p>Meditations is, in large part, Descartes’ attempt at proving the existence of God by extending the previously built foundations from his Discourse. Namely the idea, “I think therefore I am”. </p>
<p>He uses the terms “cause” and “effect” as a basis of his meditations, believing that everything in the world is an effect of some cause, such as a round pebble being the cause of flowing waters or sand carried by the wind. He then applies the cause and effect to ideas in his mind. That his ideas must have come from somewhere, either originating from himself or something else. The second part of this concept is that an effect cannot contain more than its cause. Descartes states, “For I ask: where could the effect get its reality from, apart from its cause? And how could the cause give it that reality unless it also possessed it?” (page 35). He uses a number of different terms that I simply combined as “cannot contain more than”, although the most notable term he uses is the idea of “perfect”, or that an effect cannot be more perfect than its cause.</p>
<p>Combining the two comes his grand conclusion. “Thus the idea of God is the only one left about which to ask the question: does it contain something that could not have originated from me?” (page 38).</p>
<p>He finds that the idea of God, a perfect being, could not have originated in his mind. Such an idea could only have originated from something containing the same reality as a perfect being, namely God himself.</p>
<p>That is the argument in a tight nutshell, anyway, and such an argument is what lured me into reading the book. The general consensus among scholars much smarter than me has found his arguments to be lacking. For example, the Cartesian Circle, or what some consider to be Descartes using circular reasoning for his argument, although that counter itself is argued upon. However, one must realize the importance of Descartes’ works in philosophy. His works alone have created a pre- and post- Cartesian era dividing the progress of Western Philosophy, which is not something to glance over.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given this is the Penguin Classics’ version, the book also contains 130 pages of more content on top of the 70 pages of Meditations. I highly recommend at least reading the Meditations. The later content can be a give or take depending on how much you want to further explore his ideas on the matter; however, I also highly recommend his letters between him and Princess Elizabeth.</p>
<p>I give the book a 5/6 and recommend it in place of “Discourse on Method”, although both reads can be short by ignoring the extra content the Penguin Classics version adds on. Both are bound to leave your mind swimming in thoughts.</p>
