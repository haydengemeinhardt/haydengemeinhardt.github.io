(Further arguments are addressed in my blog).</p><p>This book wasn’t for me. It was simply too broad to learn any one thing from it. Instead, it felt much more like a boy cries wolf scenario.</p><p>The entirety of the book was, in a nutshell, a survey about how our economy is in worsening shape while technology is increasingly improving. This isn’t anything new, of course, but I was expecting a deep dive into at least some specific area instead of it being a general overview. It truly felt like one long news article.</p><p>To an even greater disappointment, it wasn’t until page 249/284 that he brought solutions to the table, and then crescendoed with a conclusion on climate change that didn’t really have anything to do with the book (other than discuss a pessimistic view of the future without any real solutions).</p><p>The only real solution proposed and explored was universal basic income, though he admits it “seems virtually impossible” (page 278) in our political climate. Notice how he addresses this two pages before the conclusion… and offers no other serious alternative.</p><p>I will give this book benefit of the doubt in that it’s aim was towards a more general audience to convince them of the coming future, though I think that would be a perfect (and expected) opportunity to look at solutions.</p><p>And one last thing that drove me absolutely insane: for a book that is making an argument for one side, it does a very poor job of addressing the opposing arguments sometimes. Take for example this on page 204. One argument was supported entirely by Nobel prize winners on the previous page, then this opposing argument gets addressed as: “This idea—which seems to me to be remarkably divorced from the obvious reality—has been repeatedly disparaged by Krugman as a belief in ‘the confidence fairy’.” He did not go any further. No quotes, no evidence, no backup. That was literally his entire response. That’s not addressing an opposing argument, that is dismissing it, of which is entirely antithetical to the purpose of the book!</p><p>Instead, he spends time responding to strawman arguments like “the premise that even modestly higher marginal tax rates on top incomes will somehow destroy the impetus for entrepreneurship and investment is simply unsupportable” (page 279). I do not know anyone who has said higher taxes on the rich scare off new entrepreneurs, but he still felt the need to point out that Apple and Microsoft were founded during a time with 70% tax brackets.</p><p>I was planning on giving this book a solid 5/6, but it was never able to properly capitalize on its buildup. And I get it—there’s no easy solution and much less a copious number of solutions, hence why we haven’t been able to address it, but the book simply was not anything new. Unfortunately, it felt much more like a 3/6, like one news article.
