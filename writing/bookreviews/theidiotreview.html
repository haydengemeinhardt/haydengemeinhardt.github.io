	How do I review a Russian literature classic without sound like an idiot? Perhaps if my degree was in English I could do a better job, though maybe seeing an engineer’s perspective might give different insight.</p><p>This book has a love/hate relationship amongst most. I fell more into the hate category for a decent chunk of the middle part of the book because there were so many characters that I admittingly had trouble keeping track of. It was the biggest issue I was not prepared for. Dostoevsky introduces a large amount of characters in chunks at a time. Mix that with his lack of properly entering/exiting characters and me being terrible with names as is, plus all the names being in Russian, I just got lost. I reread a number of pages but by the time I realized, the first read was already cemented in my head.</p><p>TIP OF ADVICE: write down the names of the characters and a little detail about them. Apparently I’m not the only one who got lost.</p><p>Now, to get into the meat of things…</p><p>Dostoevsky is a true believer in Christianity, and he will write these long books as genuine attacks on values he holds dearest. And no strawman attacks either, he doesn’t go easy. This book was an attack on his views on forgiveness, to forgive and forget as a Christ-like figure.</p><p>The prince is made out to be a genuinely good person contrasted with the flaws of everyone around him, and everyone calls him an idiot at his naivety. The prince will constantly forgive and forgive and love out of mercy. The number of times he was disrespected yet still loved the person absolutely blew my mind. I thought at first I was missing something, like why on earth is he still in love right? It left me pretty much wanting to put the book down because I was so bewildered. Well, it’s a take on how someone who subscribes absolutely to this belief would survive in Russian society at the time, and the answer you receive at the end of the book.</p><p>The more I studied the book while reading it (Sparknotes, etc. without spoilers), the more I worried there was no real plot and that the story was simply 600 pages of friend/family drama (which basically turned out to be the case in some sense), and that’s where I fell off the boat. There’s tons of pieces moving around, all mingled in tons of unnecessary exchanges and details that contrasts greatly to modern books that try to keep things as concise as possible (though it’s interesting to note that in particular scenes with large groups of people, you can see everyone moving around clearly, like a film, that I haven’t quite seen in any other book). And it’s not a grand play (despite reading like one) where plots A and B collide then meet with C and D at the end. It’s more of a realistic take on life.</p><p>I absolutely loved some parts of the book. Near the beginning when everyone was struggling to understand the prince, you could see they would project themselves onto the Prince after failing to find who he truly was (albeit they only gave themselves a handful of pages before giving up, but it’s a book so whatever). The entire scene with everyone going mad over a chunk of money on fire had my eyes scrolling down the page faster than I could keep up, the whole I’ll give you what you want but I’ll make you pay embodies the meaning of spite like no other. And Hippolyte’s letter, man I plan on going back to reread that. And the general’s story about the dog on the train, that scene left me dying. There are a couple of more scenes in particular I won’t mention to avoid spoilers, but notably near the end, an exchange between two people that was kept secret had me pacing around my room as I read. It was about that moment I began falling in love with the book all over again.</p><p>And the one thing I loved the most was I saw myself as the prince more times than I care to admit, which is absolutely great considering the title of the book.</p><p>The book is by no means a thriller that would get published today. It is a long, tedious read at times. It’s value lies in the afterthought, which is why it’s crucial one researches after (or before) reading it. I give it a 4/6 for that, simply because I honestly had trouble getting through it at times. Nonetheless, I’ve ended up reading more about this book than any other so far.
