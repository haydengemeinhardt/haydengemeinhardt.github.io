<p>"No Longer Human" is one of the first Eastern books to break into the Western market and has become, in some parts, a literary classic, and in many parts, a literary masterpiece.</p>
<p>I began reading this book while waiting in line for gas after Hurricane Ida and became so obsessed with it, I reread the entirety of the forty or so pages I read while in line once I got home. I simply was not prepared for how evocative a matter-of-the-fact writing style could be. It nails the dull bluntness depression brings upon a person’s mind.</p>
<p>Most depression-oriented stories can be classified as sob stories, injecting as much death or rape or torture scenes as an author can for nothing other than shock value so the reader can feel sorry for them. "No Longer Human", while containing a number of depressing recollections, does not write as though the author aimed at extracting tears out of a read. Rather, it was stark and brusque.</p>
<p>Osamu Dazai bases the story off of a real journal he found and follows it closely, only changing the wording to make it a more enjoyable reading experience. However, it is entirely the same story, and can be classified as a semi-autobiography. The title “No Longer Human” stems from the main character’s inability to identify as a human, or someone who can relate to other humans (which is an interesting take in what it means to be human).</p>
<p>The similarities between the author and the main character are veritable for an appreciation of the book. From byronsmuse.wordpress.com, “Like Yozo, Dazai neglected his studies and took interest in Marxism, prostitutes and alcohol. Both were born in privileged families and felt guilt about it. Both attempted suicide by drowning off a beach in Kamakura with young bar hostesses. Both Yozo and Dazai survived, and both women died. Both became addicted to morphine-based painkillers. At the end, Dazai committed suicide by drowning. Yozo’s whereabouts remain unknown, although he might have done the same thing.”</p>
<p>In fact, this book was published the same year as Dazai’s suicide, 1948. Notably, this was three years after World War 2, and the state of Japan after the war is incomparable to anything the western world has experienced. We tend to forget how severe the war in the Pacific really was. The Japanese military murdered estimates of up to ten million people in horrendous ways, a famous photo being a solider playing bayonet bilboquet with a baby (look up the Rape of Nanjing for a hint). Meanwhile the homeland was bombed to ashes from the U.S. like nothing the world had ever seen, as the atomic bombs were only a fraction of the total killed civilians (not to mention the U.S.’s own Japanese internment camps we like to forget about). Dazai’s house was burned down twice itself throughout the war. Such a background into the society at the time speaks to the meaning of the book.</p>
<p>"No Longer Human" is an easy 6/6. A dark, but provoking read.</p>
