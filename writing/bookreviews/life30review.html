<p>I love this quote with the context behind it: “To me, the most inspiring scientific discovery ever is that we’ve dramatically underestimated life’s future potential” page 203</p>
<p>This book was both highly exciting and highly disappointing at the same time, and I’m torn on how to approach its rating…</p>
<p>First and foremost, it is an introductory book to the area of the future of AI. In foresight, this is made abundantly clear from chapter one, in of which Tegmark says skip chapter 2 if you are experienced in the field (and thank you so much for that!). Furthermore, Tegmark speaks many times to the AI conventions he has organized to bring attention to specifics in a field that needs attention. This book does just that. Reading the online reviews, however, it seems many (including me) were not expecting the book to only cover base-level concepts of AI and missed the memo at the beginning. That is where this book went so wrong: we were expecting an in-depth approach, not an introduction. I’m not sure who’s fault that is.</p>
<p>As an introduction, this book is absolutely amazing. I would suggest this to anyone who has little understanding of AI and wants a grasp as to where the future may lead. At no point will one be overloaded with concept; rather, it will be a continuous feed of different ideas and pathways AI could take on from an expert in the field, along with much needed optimism and warning. If this book doesn’t get them excited thinking about the future, then AI isn’t for them (in my opinion).</p>
<p>Now, for someone who has already tested the waters of the field, this book should be skipped for deeper books. There’s too much speculation into very specific, drawn out scenarios without further development into the ethics of those scenarios beyond the surface. When the author is asking more questions than giving answers, it is a red flag. </p>
<p>Additionally, most of these scenarios are extremely far into the future (harnessing energy from black holes, AI racing to obtain as much matter in the observable universe with the accelerating expansion bringing it out of reach) while more “at-hand” technologies are given less thought.</p>
<p>This book was super fun to read many times, indulging in science-fiction realities and tons of possibilities. Unfortunately, to adequately cover every topic mentioned is impossible within a single book. One might argue this means his scope is too broad, but I don’t think his goal was to ever cover these topics adequately. I believe his goal was to deliver this as the common man’s call to the potentials and dangers of AI.</p>
<p>I’m giving Life 3.0 a 4/6. Again, based on personal enjoyment. I wish it delved deeper. Still an amazing introductory book I would recommend anyone new to the field to read, and a great starting point to develop conversation.</p>
