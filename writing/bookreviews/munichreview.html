<p>From the busy shelf in a thrift store to a homely shelf in my room, the physical journey this book took is tiny in comparison to the journey told within its pages.</p>
<p>	“Munich” single-handedly reignited a spark of my awe at early 19th century European history. Told from the perspective of two fictional characters—Hugh Legat, a British diplomat, and Paul von Hartmann, a German diplomat—it covers four long days of appeasement between Chamberlain and Hitler in what is known as the Munich Agreement, where predominately ethnic German parts of Czechoslovakia (Sudetenland) were surrendered to Germany, while simultaneously giving appreciation to the Oster Conspiracy. It beautifully blended fact and fiction to the point I had to double check if the two main characters were real. </p>
<p>	Neville Chamberlain is too often portrayed as naïve and weak, or even left out entirely, when surrounding the politics of World War 2, and this story strayed from that mistake. Only in retrospect is the deal seen as a blunder, but even Hitler himself found Munich to be his greatest defeat, so take with that what you will. Britain was in no position to challenge Hitler militarily, and France only was militarily powerful on paper as their government was recently overthrown and treasury bankrupt. And no other allies, much less what little public support remained, would have joined the fight to stop Germany from ceasing the Sudetenland. </p>
<p>	This is all covered in the story, along with a couple of Chamberlain’s brilliant moves that come with decades of experience in politics. It also covers how the Czechs were not even included in the agreement and yet were forced to surrender heavily fortified and militarily, economically, and geographically strategic land to the Germans (the latter significance I was unaware of). </p>
<p>The main plot concerning Legat and Hartmann, however, was underdeveloped, and the first half of the story was rather slow. Too much back and forth between unimportant characters and small, everyday tasks dragged the chapters longer than they needed to be. It wasn’t fluff as it did keep the realism to the story, but it wasn’t interesting either, which is something I’d expect better of from an experienced writer. Even worse, the ending felt weak with regards to the main plot. Had it stood on its own without Chamberlain and co., it would have been disappointing.</p>
<p>Munich is by no means a thriller, despite being crafted and advertised as one. That is what drags the book down to a 4/6. I really, really enjoyed the latter half and its historical setting, but as a whole, it falls short of my recommended list.</p>
