<p>A very light and easy read for a midday break, and one I wish I took more notes through. A great introduction to website design (or design in general) that have led me to implementing a few of the techniques myself on this very website. In fact, this book was the reason for the latest website renovation.</p>
<p>This book takes a human approach to interface design—less methodical than some other resources that specify exactly where, when, and how to implement certain techniques. It builds on theory and uses real-world examples, two most memorable of which were the LinkedIn profile builder and a grocery store shelf. The LinkedIn example serves as a hook in of itself and I only wish I had the brilliance to design a similarly ‘seductive’ interface.</p>
<p>However, where the book falls short is the superficial touch on theory. The book even admits there is not a lot of theory on the subject, so it is not necessarily the book’s fault, but perhaps it was just written at an unideal time in website development as it is still an understudied field despite playing a key role in out society. Most of the money goes towards addicting users to social media--an obvious fact considering the big tech companies—which does not help all that much for those not making a social media platform. Take my website, for example. It seems almost every website requires you to register in order to simply browse its contents, despite serving little to no purpose for anyone but the investors.</p>
<p>As such, much of this book only skims the surface of what would be extremely interesting interaction theory and is quickly going out of date being a decade old at the time of this review. </p>
<p>I give it a 4/6 as it did pique my interest. If you are interested in interaction theory, there are better books that go deeper into it than an intro-level course. And, well, if you’re not interested, then obviously don’t bother picking up the book.</p>
