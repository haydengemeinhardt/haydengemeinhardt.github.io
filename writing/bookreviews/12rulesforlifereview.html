<p>
As an avid listener of Peterson’s numerous rants found on YouTube, 12 Rules For Life was on my list for a long time. 
</p>
<p>
What makes him so unique is the cold truth he refuses to paint pretty; and as some of those beliefs have spilled over into modern politics (specifically social justice), it has given him a spotlight to speak under. He finds many of our structures in society rooted in thousands of years of culture and millions of years of evolution, and thinks it is rather wise to listen to advice of our ancestors than throw it all away in hopes of utopia thinking we can change the nature of our Being (you can see how it has upset modern liberals).
</p>
<p>
A common theme tackled early on and developed throughout the book is Chaos and Order. That too much chaos creates too unstable lives for us to bear, and too much order leaves life dull and not worth living.
</p>
<p>
“Thus, you need to place one foot in what you have mastered and understood and the other in what you are currently exploring and mastering. Then you have positioned yourself where the terror of existence is under control and you are secure, but where you are also alert and engaged. That is where there is something new to master and some way that you can be improved. That is where meaning is to be found.” Page 44
</p>
<p>
Life is hard and the very turmoil it unearths brings Being itself into questioning. And, more often than not, your downfalls are of no fault but your own through wrong action, or inaction against wrong.
</p>
<p>
“To suffer terribly and know yourself as the curse: that is Hell. And once in Hell it is very easy to curse Being itself. And no wonder. But it’s not justifiable. And that’s why the King of the Damned is a poor judge of Being.” Page 367
</p>
<p>
The book is chock full of quotes—quotes you need to read and understand the chapters from whence they came thoroughly—that have left me walking the neighborhood at midnight or absent-minded in the shower pondering over their meanings and implications on what I previously believed to be true. (And I’m not trying to sound like some self-enlightened guru. There is a reason Peterson garners millions of listeners and is a #1 best seller).
</p>
<p>
There was a serendipitous topic it covered rigorously: religion. It gave me a whole new aspect to explore with regards to religion and how its thousands of years of meticulous writing was not something to interpret shallowly or put aside lightly. Trying to summarize it within a review wouldn’t do it justice, so I won’t even try.
</p>
<p>
If there was one quote that summed the whole book for me, it would be this:
</p>
<p>
“For Neumann, and for Jung, consciousness—always symbolically masculine, even in women—struggles upwards toward the light. Its development is painful and anxiety-provoking, as it carries with it the realization of vulnerability and death. It is constantly tempted to sink back down into dependency and unconsciousness, and to shed its existential burden. It is aided in that pathological desire by anything that opposes enlightenment, articulation, rationality, self-determination, strength and competence—by anything that shelters too much, and therefore smothers and devours.” Page 323
</p>
<p>
Now, that’s not to say the book had its faults. Many times, it felt like his rants were irrelevant or led to dead ends (ex: he spent multiple pages talking about his dog when a couple of paragraphs would have sufficed). Rule 12 (the same one he talked about his dog) felt rushed or underdeveloped. Rule 5 talked mostly about how to raise kids properly, and while there were some good lessons to read about, I felt that, as a single twenty-year-old still in college, reading about how to raise kids was rather soporific.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, I give this book a solid 6/6. I have been a fan of Jordan Peterson for years and he never fails to open my mind to something new (no matter how long it may take him to explain it :P)
