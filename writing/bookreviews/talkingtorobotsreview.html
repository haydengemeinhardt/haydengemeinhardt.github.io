<p>Talking To Robots: journalism disguised as science fiction. An attempt at writing from the perspective of a future human experiencing the future of robotics, but with the same thoughts as a modern person. Well, it makes sense, you're interviewing modern people so you're going to get modern answers. No one is good at predicting the future.</p>
<p>	I was overtly perfervid in my excitement for the book whenever a friend would catch me flipping through its pages in the Cambre Atrium. Afterall, it’d be my first Human-Robot Interaction book outside of clickbait journalism or formal academic papers. Yet, as said by the legend himself from TheReportOfTheWeek, “My disappointment is immeasureable, and my day is ruined”.</p>
<p>	I knew this book wasn’t for me in the first paragraph of chapter 3, with the love robot. I nestled into the purple cushions of a chair in the lecture hall of my next class, pulling my makeshift bookmark from the crease of the spine, and shortly after a brief yawn I read, “You want to make love to a giant manta ray or scale a virtual penis that’s three miles high? No problem!” I immediately closed the book and put it away.</p>
<p>	The best part is, he talks about sex literally every single chapter. I’m not kidding. And it’s wildly concerning from the viewpoint that he is, in a way, on the forefront of spreading the concepts of the future of HRI. </p>
<p>Here’s another absolute banger from the teddy bear bot, a bot designed to teach kids about life as they grow up (essentially taking the place of a parent), he goes on to say, “These new-version Teddy Bots were also reprogrammed to specifically be loved only by small nippers so that older children would outgrow them before they reached an age when they might want to pervert Teddy’s cute cuddliness.” </p>
<p>Or on page 263 when discussing a time-travel tourist bot “when the first [tourists] had sex with Neanderthals, which was surprisingly lovely, sensual, and pleasant”. I can literally go on like this for the entirety of the book.</p>
<p>And yet, the strangest thing about all of this is, the stories are truly written like they were made for kids to read. Take for example the Daemon Bot, an interview that was recovered from audio files after a cave collapse on Mars. The survivor uploaded himself to the Daemon Bot during the early settlement era and then the bot survives. Years later when it’s finally dug up, he becomes a “superstar on how to live forever through your Daemon Bot”.</p>
<p>I cannot take this book seriously. I swear the stories are written as though kids were supposed to read it, but then it is filled with half-baked philosophical one-liners, pages about how Trump was a bad president, or random notes about emergency condom delivery drones and white supremacist Teddy Bots that said kids would cut a hole in the back of when they got old enough. 2/6.</p>
