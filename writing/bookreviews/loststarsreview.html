<p>
Let me start this off by saying this was the first non-fiction book I have read on my own in a long time (more about that can be found in my blog). I had bought it after seeing a Star Wars book in clearance at a Barnes and Noble one day while studying and could not help myself.
</p>
<p>
The book gives the perspective of soldiers involved in the galactic war between the Rebellion and the Empire, as opposed to the usual over-powered heroes of the Star Wars universe we are so accustomed to seeing. An aspect one of my favorite shows, “The Clone Wars”, excels at as opposed to its theatrical counterparts.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, we are quickly and consistently introduced to our favorite Star Wars characters throughout the novel, leaving serendipitous bits of excitement as you read along. I still recall the jump of joy I received when the two main characters, Thane Kyrell and Ciena Ree, stumble upon Grand Moff Tarkin on their home planet of Jelucan in the outer ring territory.
</p>
<p>
Seeing the perspective of two characters that worked hard from the ground up to earn their ranks, as you and I would do, gives the reader such an interesting viewpoint. Some events the reader may have previously celebrated in the theaters instead leave them dreary. It brings realism into war. Realism that otherwise gets looked over to create a happy-go-lucky story.
</p>
<p>
Yet, this is also where the story fell short for me. It often skipped over the few small, but major moments in the midst of battle and continues the story afterward. Like reading about saving someone from a burning house, but cutting past the escape out as the roof starts falling in.
</p>
<p>
The greatest thing the story had going for it was the character development. The degree in which some characters changed varied greatly, but it always made sense. There was a reason behind it, and a story as to why they were how they were in the first place.
</p>
<p>
An unanticipated trope of the story, though one I should not have been surprised by after learning about the other stories the author had wrote, is the heavy romance throughout the book. I have to say, I was not expecting some of the “in the moment” scenes to put it lightly.
</p>
<p>
Those parts of the story did, unfortunately, make it feel a bit cheesy. I fear if the book did not fall into the Star Wars universe, I might not have enjoyed it as much as I did.
</p>
<p>
Still, the book managed to keep me reeled in, although just barely. To put it into perspective, I read over half of it in a day while the power was out, but when the power came on, I was ready to take a break.
</p>
<p>
In the end, I give this book a 5/6, based purely on how I enjoyed it. However, to a more experienced reader, or one that is not a huge fan of Star Wars, you could pass on it.
