	Let’s all take a moment to appreciate how computers have left some of our lives relatively unaffected the last few months.
</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>
Ah, good. I gotta say, for me, the only thing that has changed is not having to take my hour long commute up to the university every morning at the crack of dawn. Don’t get me wrong, a long drive can be meditating, but not if you spend the entire time crossing your fingers there isn’t an accident on the way. Some professors (one in particular whom’s name shall go unspoken until I graduate) aren’t so forgiving…
</p>
<p>
NOW, time for my history nerd side of me to come out.
</p>
<p>
Rewind a few hundred years from 1347 to 1352, the time when there were barely enough alive to bury the dead. This was the Black Death, the most well known Bubonic Plague pandemic. 60% of the population of Europe gone, 80 million to 30 million in a matter of 5 years. Literally worse than a Thanos snap.
</p>
<p>
Frankly, there was not much they could do about it. Doctors were really only there to record the deaths. Some communities got completely wiped out, while other cities remained relatively unaffected. Milan, for example, was a huge trading hub and survived (crazy enough). 
</p>
<p>
But wait, wouldn’t a place like that be most susceptible to a plague spread by the fleas of rats on ships? Actually, the Black Death was not spread by rats. Common misconception. There is evidence from the Bubonic Plague of 1819 that it was possibly spread by rats, though not the Black Death. Instead, the plague mixed with other diseases that caused it to mutate into a pneumonic form and become airborne (though it could have originated from the fleas of rats). One piece of evidence is how the plague crossed Europe in a year, covering a mile a day. Rats migrate, but not that fast, and when they find a nice place they settle down.
</p>
<p>
Back then, one of the first theories was a foul smell could transmit diseases. This is actually evidence that people were more hygienic than commonly believed, but that’s another story. Another misconception is this theory created the “plague masks” during the Black Death, the long nosed masks doctors wore. The masks were used to put nice smelling herbs in the pit of the nose to get rid of the foul smells. These masks did not exist back then, rather they came up during the Renaissance.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, people knew contact with others transmitted the disease. Because of this, they would enact quarantine measures very strictly. The average would last roughly 30-40 days. Now think about this. Being stuck in a small home with no entertainment like we have and without the ability to work during a time period you needed to work a lot more to survive. And if someone in the house got it… Well, everyone else was going to die too. That is, if they stayed.
</p>
<p>
Some people would send their family off to save them. But what if your child caught it and you knew they were going to die in a day’s time? Would you stay by their side during their last hours so they did not have to die alone, or run to save yourself and come home to their corpse? That is a tough decision that many people had to face back then.
</p>
<p>
All in all, let’s be glad we live in the world we do today.
