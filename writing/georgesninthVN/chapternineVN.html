		chapter = ['The feeling when something was lost that should not have been lost was exemplified in that should not was mistaken for would not. Then suddenly, all could be lost—even life itself, and mortality becomes not some far distant event but a continuous state of being. George’s death should’ve been that very enlightenment I was promised. Instead, the sudden emerging void consumed the vitality of the surrounding spirit like an open door on a snowy day until the warm air balanced into an equilibrium of a much lower level of energy.', 'The urge to vomit when I touched George beneath the water still lingered, the separation of soul from body a foreign feeling, when bodies were simply occupied as opposed to being the person themselves, was still composed of the same, albeit recycled, puke that bubbled mid-sprint whose release was validation of pushing myself hard enough to enjoy my privileged life, for what is Heaven without Earth to a Newportian? And as far as souls had been extracted from their bodies, I had separated myself from the lifeless society and their illogical values. Yet, no matter how much I thought myself different from others, I was still human at heart: with George gone, I was lonely on my path, for who else was there to play chase with me? I might as well had been going insane on the path a thousand yards from everyone else. ', 'And so I was: For the fifth time that month, I was adventuring into an unknown home for a respite from the ground-state of monotony. Oh, how I lusted for the thrill of running from police through backyards and over fences, across streets and into woods—“Catch me if you can, oh masters, and I will submit to your will!” Not a cop in the city would nor could ever dream of catching Mickey Lee. Yet, it would forever remain just a fantasy in my head, as no one had ever called the police for anything I stole because nothing I stole was ever worth calling the police for.', 'No one would hunt someone down over a missing stick of gum, nor over the concomitant sticking of it under their desk when they’re not looking. Not that I had done the latter—there was no thrill in some callow declaration of individualism, to say “I’m not going to follow your rules but bend them and watch you pull your hair out at the thought”. And that’s what made it all the more fun, like stealing an apple from a billionaire. I got half the thrill of a real heist and all of the thrill of getting away with it and doing it again the next day. And the next day. And so on to the heart’s content.', 'The houses themselves, however, were hardly half the ones of my dream. They were as bleak as the white and black stock cars I worked on daily. It’s not something seen from the outside. It was only after entering one house after another with the expectations of a dream and finding equivalent disappointment every time in all the same ways, like cubicles in a corporate office. The only contrast was within the houses themselves, in the differences between the rooms of the parents and those of the kids. A parent is orderly, organized, ordinary, and obstinate. Their rooms are of pure utility: a large bed and a dresser and too small a television upon that dresser and a clock set to ring at six in the morning. The kid’s room is cluttered and chaotic, their only sense of ownership limited to their room. Then they grow older, their rooms become proportionally mundane to their solidification in it, until they themselves get their own house and their own kids.', 'It is all the same. Even down to where they hide the secrets. After a few times, it’s easy to spot the hiding spots. All it took was to imagine living in the room myself, to view it not from the doorway but from the desk or the bed. The journal in my hand was found atop a shelving unit, pushed to the back where any hands running across the top without reaching back would miss it. I opened the notebook and turned to a random page:', '“He makes me feel like the lady I am, he tells me he will take care of me. I am scared but all I know right now is I want to spend more time with him and I wanna keep seeing him. He is such a gentleman. He kissed me after he walked me to my car, and I could tell he can be very shy since he keeps joking about giving everyone a show. Part of me is scared and I hope he does not lose interest in me. But it is like he can read my mind. Every minute I spend doubting if this man is still into me, he lets me know his intentions- that he is excited to see me, he cannot wait to see me, he texts me first, etc.. I just hope I can resolve these self-sabotaging tendencies. The truth is I am just so scared of getting hurt again and being vulnerable.”', 'Even the secrets themselves were all the same. Would they be considered secret any longer? Would it be a secret that one had ten toes if they always wore shoes? To think that everyone had the same problems, that everyone lived the same lives at heart. Why were there only those handful of problems, and how had we not found a solution to them yet? Why do we play these problems on repeat? The same small, small problems dictating lives, trivial compared to dreams. Was that life such a good story that it could be played eight billion times on repeat and never get old?', 'After reading the same secret stories over and over, I saw the patterns: money, beauty, fame—acceptance and admiration. To drive loud cars and pucker up their lips, so that they may finally receive the affirmation they silently longed for. To grind video games for the feeling of accomplishment in a setting designed to trick them into that feeling as doing so in real life was too difficult. To want to go to a fancy college simply because everyone else wanted to go there and would nod in approval at my having been accepted. ', 'Once in frame, it was easy to see just how animalistic we acted—as a bunch of chimpanzees who fought to be the head of the herd so that they would survive and their genes would be passed on. We knew this too; it was not news. We were taught the fact in school year after year, such that it was as familiar to us as water was to fish, much the same way as we learned that there was such a thing as death. Fact alone is taught—of atoms and evolution and cells. But who really sat down and contemplated what the facts meant, as opposed to just accepting it as fact as only the fact itself mattered? It felt that not even the teachers themselves understood the facts, for if they did, they would understand that even those facts were hardly understood to begin with. The question of “why” only went so deep before we relied on emotion and reason stemming directly from those animalistic desires, and I started to realize that it was a very shallow ocean of knowledge I had been taught that gave the veil of understanding the world. Everything we understood and valued was derived from those animal desires, but I had grown to loathe a society in which it was their desires that caused me to loathe them, stripping me of valuing those desires and thus valuing almost nothing at all, so that I despised every corner of the city I turned.', 'Headlights shone in through the windows. The garage rumbled as its door screeched its way up. I raised myself off the bed and set the journal back atop the shelf and gently shut the bedroom door behind me. A door on the other side of the house opened and with it voices of kids bickering amongst themselves and rushing to their rooms. I made my way to the backdoor with their trampling footsteps around the corner behind me. They were so anxious to resume their play, so happy and grateful to be in the world that they couldn’t get enough of it. That drive of mine had long vanished.', 'I reached the back doors in the kitchen. It was dreadfully dark outside. The living room lights flicked on and streamed into the kitchen, reflecting a translucent image of myself reflected off the glass. I wished I could have fully seen my face. It felt like a mess. I unlocked the latch and slid the door open, then stepped out into the chilling breeze. The parents yelled at the kids from the living room to get their snacks before bed. I slid the door shut behind me. It was the ultimate loneliness, for I was a complete outsider standing in the cold looking in at the warm light of being normal again.', 'End of Chapter'];
