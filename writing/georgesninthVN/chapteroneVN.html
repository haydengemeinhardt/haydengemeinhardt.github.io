		test = ['“I’m horrendously jealous of him.”', '“He’s quite the guy,” Lucas said, lassoing his backpack over the neck of the chair, “but I don’t understand. There’s not a lot to him to be horrendously jealous about.”', '“He got his life story in before the deadline. Bad thing turned miracle, and now he knows why he wants to do the things he wants to do. It’s not enough that he wants to. He knows he wants to.”', 'I slumped into the chair across from Lucas, the sun warming my skin through the window of the chilly Cafe Du Mont. It was the world’s worst cafe: loud, busy, and an ill-assorted collection of art. The floor was sticky with unscrubbable spills so every step sounded like squeaky tennis shoes against linoleum. The tables were small and wobbly and the chairs had a deafening creak under a child’s weight. Even the lights were too bright.', 'But they had one dollar coffee.', '“Maybe,” Lucas said, “but miracles only come from tragedy, and why would anyone wish for that?”', 'A piercing order shot from the counter, fighting to be heard over the clamor, carrying with it much the same question: “1 pump caramel syrup, 1 pump hazelnut syrup, 1 pump toffee nut syrup, 1 pump peppermint syrup, 1 pump raspberry syrup…” God forbid she had been any quieter, might miss a syrup pump.', 'I shook my head and looked back to Lucas. My mind had an unwavering ability to lose focus that day; I was not feeling right. ', '“Don’t you ever think,” I said, “‘well, nothing good has happened to me, so maybe I want something bad to happen to me. Maybe even a sad life is one worth living more than the nothingness of my own. And maybe something good will happen after that’?”', '“Sounds masochistic.”', '“We’re runners, Lucas. We’re first and foremost masochists.”', '“Still…”', 'He held those same ideations. I knew it. I knew him. I knew how he ran. Him and I were much the same chasing after a dream. It was the divide in life’s path between meaning and monotony: those who held telling, beautiful lives rich in stories, and those like Lucas and I who struggled to conjure up an exaggerated tale of their life because all they had done was the same as everyone else, and everyone else was bored or depressed.', 'I looked to the girl who stood idly scrolling through her phone while waiting on her flavored sap. What was her life story? How could she be so much more content with life than I?', 'Margaret slid the girl her drink and popped out from behind the counter, greeting us with a smile. Her shoes squelched on the sticky tile. Her stride fastened her apron against her body by the breeze. She carried a spray bottle and rag to disguise our chat as her cleaning the table for us, even though it was already cleaned as it always was before we got here, sweet as she was. Her smile then dropped to a frown.', '“Where’s George?” she questioned, spraying the table and slapping the rag on it. ', 'What she really meant was “where’s Jenny?”, as Jenny was Margaret’s replacement at three o’clock, and it was two fifty-five, and George was Jenny’s ride, and Margaret couldn’t take much more.', 'The table wobbled as she dizzied the rag about it, waiting for an answer.', '“He probably rear-ended someone,” Lucas joked, leaning back into his creaky chair.', '“They’ll be here,” I said. “If not, we’ll take over the counter until then.”', 'Lucas shot me a glare. “Who’s we?”', 'Margaret put her hands to her hips. “Do you two idiots even know how to work a cash register?”', 'Much to Margaret’s relief, the door chimed with the entrance of Jenny and George. Jenny held the door open for George as he carried a small kitten in his arms—not that he owned a kitten, but in the five minutes between school and here, he couldn’t resist finding something in the world to make a story out of.', 'The room perked in his direction as he walked over to our table.', '“Sorry, we got a little preoccupied,” George said, cradling the kitten. “Guys, meet Joey. Joey, meet the guys.”', 'But it wasn’t just Lucas and I he was introducing Joey to. People from neighboring tables gathered to peek. They made little “aww”s and George told them all about Joey like he and Joey were longtime friends.', '“He really likes chicken and sleeping, and scratches behind the ears.”', 'It was who George was: a smile stretched across his face as strangers swarmed to him like a celebrity.', 'I was told life is only good if you’re wealthy, smart, and handsome. My family was far wealthier than George’s, my grades were a tier above his, and I was, as honestly as I could be, better looking than him as well. I studied these aspects of myself and of all the traits that differentiated me from him. I contemplated our disparity far more than any religion or woman. There was not a facet in the million that shaped a person in which George could proclaim superior. I made sure of that, for I worked for years to make it so after having come to my realization about him. Yet, what had I over him? My only real flaw was my lack thereof—not that my life was perfect, but that there was no obstacle to overcome apart from any obstacle I made for myself. That is not an honorable stand made against God. It is play-pretend while everyone else partakes in real journeys.', 'Dare I say I am jealous of the deaf and amputated and orphaned, those struck by tragedy and unable to ever experience the catharsis of music nor their mother’s graceful wrap? I will never experience the struggles they faced nor have the stories to tell that make my life different from anyone else’s. What was there not to be jealous about?', 'As people came and went to meet George and Joey, Jenny went to get our usual drinks and Lucas pulled out his notebook. To us, it was another day around George as participants in his Truman show. ', 'I was content with being cast as a supporting actor. I loved the man. But sometimes I think, why didn’t I do that? Why didn’t I hop on the table and sing? Why didn’t I sign up as a volunteer in Kenya? Why didn’t I learn to play the guitar or speak another language? Why didn’t I get a job at the world’s worst cafe?', 'When Jenny returned, the room settled back down to what one would expect a Cafe Du Mont to be. Still a cacophonous mess, but not quite so bad. Like kicking dirty clothes under the bed. So our band of inveterate three p.m. caffeine addicts relaxed with our after-school beverages: George and I with our black coffees, Jenny with her vanilla latte, and Lucas with his shot of expresso. We needed it, for the existential question demanded to be answered or our lives forfeit. That one George had transcribed for him while Lucas and I remained lost.', '"I got a good one for you guys today," Lucas said. “And you too Jenny, if you got a minute?”', '“Let’s hear it,” she said.', 'Lucas pushed back his chair as he stood, cleared his throat, then sonorously quoted with one hand gripping the folded notebook and the other animating the air as an assertive orator, “You ask a man on the verge of death how he’d go about consecrating his final day, and you’ll receive nothing short of drugs, sex, and gluttony, and perhaps if he’s a conventional fellow he’ll say one last good bye to his family. Surely there’s a greater thrill in life than that to pursue?”', 'The entire café could’ve listened if they so pleased, yet he continued proudly. I couldn’t listen. If it was the best we had, how hopeless we were.', '“Doesn’t sound like too bad of a day,” George interrupted as he reached for the notebook. Lucas indiffidently handed it over with an optimistic flick of the wrist, certain he finally nailed the introduction. George promptly tore the page in a fistful and, with the same confident flick of the wrist, chucked it into a nearby trash can. "A conventional fellow?" He chuckled.', 'Jenny snagged the notebook from George and smacked him upside the head with it before tossing it back. Lucas stretched his arms out to catch it, careful not to crease any pages. He was particularly fastidious regarding unnecessary imperfections, growing up as a messy kid with parents who didn’t take so kindly to his consistent picking. Yet, he was rather distracted for once with Jenny’s defense of him and eagerly asked, “So do you think my intro is okay?”', 'She bit her lip. “Well, you’re applying to pre-med. Shouldn’t you be saying something about, like, arteries or tissues?”', '“It won’t be doctors reading my application, will it?” He sighed and turned to me for one final hope at approval, but I sat with folded arms. “Oh, come on, you too Mickey?”', '“It sounds like it’s missing something.” I tried not to be as harsh as the others, but Lucas valued my opinion in such a way that any negative judgment would make him reconsider even the most certain of decisions. ', '“But there’s something to be said about it, right?”', 'I decided then that I wanted him to reconsider. “Only of how bland it is.”', '“You don’t even know where I was going with it.”', '“Not to Duke.”', 'With those brusque words, Lucas flipped to a new page, forgetting that George had already done so for him, then continued to switch between biting the frayed rubber eraser of the pencil and the remains of his lunch, contriving the next disappointingly sententious opener. Lucas had been at it for weeks and hadn’t even a rough draft to show. Panic was settling in. Having generations of family trek a path that Lucas would be unable to keep on was nothing short of disheartening.', '“You’re just going to have to accept that you won’t be getting in,” Jenny said.', 'His face twitched. He set down the notebook book and continued twirling his pencil. “I have to at least try.” And so was the catch: a chance he would be able to prove that he could live up to his word.', '“Why don’t you write your story like we’ve been telling you?” Jenny asked.', '“Because,” he said, slapping his hands against the table, “I don’t have any story different from every other privileged white kid in our school.”', 'It was who Lucas was: a kid who had had everything he had thought he wanted short of a private yacht, and even then he hadn’t the desire for one if the opportunity shone itself, as he had no care for the ocean. Everything about his life was so satiated it became dull, and in the dullness no desire to strive further shone itself; that if being dissatisfied with life was necessary to being satisfied with life, he was neither. And that’s what we were: two dull guys who met on the track, without a story or a purpose in life, pulling each other along day by day, in all practicalities living to prove ourselves to each other rather than any person, any god, or any culture, but yet with the same anxiety one would have with all of those at once.', 'George feigned a palpable tsk. “Lucas, I love you and everyone else at this school, but just because you were born with an advantage doesn’t mean there’s any extra expectation of you in life.”', '“But the desire claws at me—the one desire I’ve had in my life—and I can’t lie to myself about it.”', '“And I’m sure the desire to fuck someone and smoke a cigarette with them afterward would claw at you too if you’d give it a try.”', '“I don’t want to live a boring life. I want to be—”', '“Yet here you are,” George interrupted, “living your life by scribbling in a notebook so that someday you can live your life. This day tossed aside as if it weren’t worthy of living on its own. It’s not even entirely your fault but come on—” George’s words were cut short by a ring from his phone. “Mom” he said and excused himself to take it.', '“Hmm, that might be a good one,” Lucas said, trying not to show the strike with which George’s words had hit him. Only at Jenny and I’s collective sigh did Lucas retract it with “kidding” and slump back into his chair. “Oh, Mickey, how’s your essay going?”', 'I looked down at the pages of the notebook in front of me. It was full of words and phrases and quotes, some scratched out, others underlined. It wasn’t empty, but the jumbled ideas were baseline, directionless, and irreconcilable. “I’m not sure.”', '“Well, let’s hear it,” Lucas said. “I read mine loud and proud. You should too.”', 'In the moment, I hesitated. The next, I wondered how I was seriously supposed to wish I was George if I was too shy to even read aloud a rough draft of an essay with all the eager ears expecting a rough draft of an essay. So, I cleared my throat, lifted my notebook, and read aloud, “When I ran as a child, I knew then that I liked to run. When I read as a child, I knew then that I liked to read. When I strummed the strings of a guitar as a child, I knew then that I liked to create music with my own hands. But when I…”', 'Over the shoulder of Lucas, I saw George walk back with his head down. When he lifted it, I saw the same look I had seen years ago, like a visible shadow had shaded his wide eyes from above.', '“Mom has cancer again.”', 'The table fell silent. All emotion was wrung out like a strained cloth. Whatever page Lucas was writing on slowly fell on the table into a crease. Jenny’s mouth twitched, as though she was about to yell at George for playing a late and cruel April Fool’s joke, but even in the face of her denial, no actor in the world could masquerade the face that plagued George.', 'There are certain phrases I do not know how to respond to. Those from parents, when the disappointment is so great that they take responsibility for your mistakes. “I should have never let you do that.” Those from girls that us guys just don’t get, where there is no correct response. “Would you still love me if I was a worm?”. Those from the police, which weren’t a problem at the time. “Why would you steal something so petty?”. Those from college applications. “Share your story”. Then those from friends.', 'The first had come when we were only thirteen. “Mom has cancer,” he had said. When a friend tells you that, you think carefully about what to say. I had stood frozen in that moment, cycling through a number of sarcastic, optimistic, pitiful, sympathetic statements before I had decided there was nothing I could have said which would have made his heart feel better. Lucas and I had given a nod of agreement and hugged him.', 'His mom survived, but damn do I hate him for it. Sometimes I wish he had said, “Tomorrow I’m going to tell you my mom has cancer.” Sometimes I wish death would warn, “tomorrow I’m going to visit you.” Sometimes I wish even the weather would say “tomorrow I’m going to pour like hell” or my computer “tomorrow I’m going to retire”, but the former two would be the beginnings of great stories, for every great story begins with a great phrase.', 'Not great in delight, but great in impression, influence, or impact. “I am a sick man… I am a spiteful man," Dostyesvsky wrote. “Ships at a distance have every man’s wish on board,” Hurston wrote. “Justice? You get justice in the next world, in this world you have law,” Gaddis wrote. But unlike Dostoyevsky or Hurston or Gaddis, and much unlike the last great story of George, this didn’t feel great.', 'His line was blunt. It had been done before, a story written, read, and told, yet we were to go through it once again. It did nothing but reinforce my belief that stories stay with one throughout their life, lingering in the background, constantly giving life to the body it followed. It didn’t feel great to me because it wasn’t my story, so it sounded the same. Maybe Lucas was right. Maybe I wouldn’t want to be on the wrong side of a bad story.', 'But maybe to George, it sounded like music. A piece he had heard once before that tore him apart the day he heard it. How beautiful the piece must be, and how unfortunate I am to be unable to hear it.', 'End of Chapter'];
