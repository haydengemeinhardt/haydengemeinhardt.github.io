		test = ['I buried my face in the rough fabric of the towel as I wiped away the remaining moisture from my skin. I was at one point drenched, but my mouth was dry, and my lips drier.', '“It was a gray Cadillac,” I said. I paused to let the officer jot in the form and tossed the towel over my shoulder. “Some sedan, don‘t remember the model.”', 'Camera crews were framing shots of the scene, a circus of pseudo-artists gathering clips in cheap attempts to rend hearts during the local news segments. One lined the camera with a stretched strand of yellow tape that twisted and swayed each time a car rubbernecked past. Another camera was on the less crowded end of the bridge catching pictures of the face of the dam itself then properly lit by a flood light.', 'The officer interrogating Lucas led him to their cruiser. Lucas draped his towel over the passenger seat.', '“Lucas!” I called. He didn’t hear me. I started towards him and the officer stuck their arm out. ', '“I need you to finish with me,” they said. “Now, did you catch sight of the driver?”', 'Lucas climbed in the cruiser and shut the door.', '“Kind of,” I said.', '“Can you give your best description?”', '“All I could see was someone in a suit.”', '“Could you identify their sex or race?”', '“Don’t remember.” ', '“Could you estimate their height or weight?”', '“No.”', 'The officer nodded and scribbled slowly and methodically. The cruiser pulled away with Lucas inside. ', '“How about the car?” they asked. “ Did you notice any distinguishing details?”', '“No,” I said with a sigh, shifting my weight.', '“Did you catch any letters or numbers on the license plate?”', '“Can’t you just check the security cameras around here?” I asked, waving my hand in the air.', '“You let us handle the investigation,” they spat, focusing on the clipboard.', 'I crooked my head. For what reason did they have to talk to me like that? If they cared so much about hunting down a perpetrator, fine! I could’ve pointed to a dozen at the foot of the bridge if they so pleased. I thrusted the towel on their clipboard and resumed my so-rudely-interrupted run past them. I was already making awful time. The average person could have passed me by then. Pah!', '“Hey! Stop!”', 'I clenched my fists amidst a brisk pace that should’ve been taken for me fleeing the scene. The dreams flooded my mind: <i>Chase me! Let me live a story in my name! Give me a good race in George’s stead!</i> But the blue lights danced idly in place, fading behind the trees and homes as the road curved up along the side of the hill, and the tumult was consumed by the distant vacuum of silence, replaced by an infinite, humble orchestra of crickets perpetually out of reach. With no pursuit nor race, no one to prove myself to, I failed to keep a steady pace. I hadn’t run alone since a nasty flu swept the school years ago and bedrid both George and Lucas. Not me, though, for nothing bad ever happens to Mickey Lee.', 'A pair of headlights casted my shadow onto the road before me. I maneuvered to the middle of their lane. The lights split my shadow in two as they charged toward my back, then twisted into the other lane and swept past me with a brush of air. A minute later, another car sped from the opposing direction. I wandered into its lane. It merged into my old lane and hummed past. I positioned myself so that my two feet ran aligned with the double-dividing lines. Cars ceased to come.', 'They only resumed once I was safely up my empty driveway. My curse aurated as tangibly as a bubble of borealis lights–a stark contrast to the liminal house before me. Dad’s truck was gone, and presumably with Flint, as I heard no barking.', 'The front door was unlocked. I entered, climbed the stairs, and shed my clothes. I messaged Jenny then hopped straight into a long, cold shower without giving the water time to warm. I waited for my phone to ding, and after an hour, I began to think I missed it. I turned off the water and checked my phone. She hadn’t responded. I tried calling her. No answer. I threw on my work clothes from earlier–a black long sleeve shirt and jeans–and drove to her house, jerking awake each time my car vibrated on the rumble strips. I tried calling her again, the last bit of the pause between each ring teasing me with an answer until it went to voicemail.', 'I parked my car on the curb of the Lebedev household. It looked as empty as the one I left. I rang the doorbell to no avail. Jenny’s car was absent from its usual spot in the driveway. She must’ve heard what happened.', 'I sped to the nearest hospital and scoured the parking lot for Jenny’s car before finding a spot of my own. Then I hurried into the waiting room of the emergency wing. Again, Jenny was nowhere in sight. I approached a counter where a nurse or secretary or some worker was staring at a monitor.', '“Hello,” I said, “can you tell me if a George Lebedev is here?”', 'She continued staring at the monitor. “Is this person a family member?”', '“Kind of,” I replied. “I’ve known him my whole life.”', '“Sorry,” she said, clacking on her keyboard. “I can’t disclose any information.”', 'Can’t disclose information? Who decided that?', 'A stretcher was rushed into the wing and pushed through a parted set of gray doors on the other side. The doors swung closed moments later, granting me only a peek at the whitelisted party specially designed such that tragedy does not become cake for the masses to divulge. George was definitely back there. Where else would he be? ', 'I turned back and leaned onto the counter. “I am related to him.”', 'She peered over her glasses. “Driver’s license please.”', 'I pulled the license from my billfold and handed it to her. “We have different last names.”', 'She took half a glance and shook her head with pursed lips. I snagged my card back and continued past the counter to the double doors. She called for security and security promptly escorted me outside.', 'I slumped onto a nearby wood-slat bench with a deep sigh. I just wanted the day to be over. Where was Jenny? I would’ve searched the city for her, had I not believed her to be inside, tethered to George and rightfully so. I bobbed my leg waiting for a text with nowhere else to go.', 'Unfortunately, the view of the parking lot was far less appetizing than that of my room. The occasional passing of a pedestrian to and from the doors buzzed in my ear, griping and griping that they couldn’t believe such a thing could’ve happened in life despite how complacent they had been, or that the costs of a short visit were too much to bear as they climbed into their thirty thousand dollar car. ', 'Amongst the trickle stopped a man lighting a cigarette at the foot of the door. The cigarette smoldered between his gluttonous fingers, an urge as inescapable as the oscillating of a pen during math class. The fumes lingered into my nostrils. ', 'He flicked the ashes and watched them fall to the ground, catching me in his periphery. He paused, then looked back into the parking lot and took another puff.', '“Cruel world,” he said.', 'He couldn’t see me, but I looked him up and down conspicuously–clean dress shoes, fine tailored tweed suit, flashy watch, fresh haircut–the illustration of a primitive need to impress the nurses. ', '“Indeed,” I replied.', '“Cruel god.”', 'A sneer tickled like a sneeze. “What has he done to you?”', '“My daughter is sick,” he said, far too eagerly, “with a disease and no cure. What god allows that?”', 'There was the question: Could a god be so cruel as to allow a child to have a disease? What would that make me? For I could imagine many things I could do worse had cruelty been my name.', '“Well,” I said, “it’s an awfully good thing that our society is filled with outstanding citizens contributing to a cure.”', 'He took a last puff. “Indeed,” he said.', '“Would be cruel to not contribute anything.”', 'It was an unfair assumption that I didn’t enjoy making after having made it. I wanted to poke him. I wanted him to prove me wrong. He didn’t seem to notice. He simply nodded. A few moments of silence passed. He stomped out his cigarette. “Have a good evening,” he said and returned inside.', 'I laid between the railings on the bench with bent knees then closed my eyes, for even though one might fantasize staring down a cruel god having finally peeled their eyes from the ground, light from the window polluted the view. Still, with closed eyes, I couldn’t sleep. The constant trickle of people was like cold water dripping on my forehead in five second intervals. And although I’ve slept soundly on hardwood floor numerous times when I found my bed too plush, the bench was like laying on hot asphalt, for my blood boiled. It was a sacred, almost unbearable feeling I loved to bathe in as much as I loathed it.', 'The last pair of footsteps I heard leaving the hospital stopped a few feet from the door and turned course toward my bench. They approached eagerly yet hesitantly and stopped at the base. A hand rustled my hair. I opened my eyes. Jenny stood over me, dressed in the same light-blue jeans and over-sized white t-shirt finger painted with oil. Her face was red and wet, her hair a mess.', 'As I sat up to meet her, she planted herself in the seat next to me. She wrapped her arms around me. She clung the back of my shirt. She dried her face in my neck and tickled my throat with her breath—too damp, too sensitive. She reminded me too clearly: it was my fault that I fell asleep at work; it was my fault that we ran the more dangerous route by my house; it was my fault that I couldn’t keep up with George; it was my fault I hesitated to jump in after Lucas; it was my fault I searched half-heartedly; it was my fault.', 'A voice cried <i>Behold, your dream! Your symphony! You young composer of life, of living and being!</i> But where was the prize? I lusted terribly for the reaping of my story, for the fat stuffed bear from the top rack of the pearly carnival stand to fly my way. I longed to see my friend.', 'I asked softly, “have you seen him yet?”', '“He’s not him anymore,” she said.', 'I told Jenny about my interaction with the desk person and asked for her permission to see him. She nodded and led me to a room where only one visitor was allowed at a time–a strange rule to protect an absent body. Might they have expected a line outside the room? ', 'No one liked George for his body alone, and so alone on the hospital bed it laid. Tubes and wires were strung about keeping it alive as stubborn as it was, but there comes a point when even the most stubborn of a person cannot deny reality for reality doesn’t wait for anyone to accept it. I imagined George came to this realization as he was face-down in the water. He was too much for the world and it had finally worked up the courage to rid itself of him. His body was like one whose spirited soul was ripped out of it so that he merely existed like the rest of us, as he was always meant to merely do. He lived his never-ending climax of a story to the very last page. Bearing witness to its end was his godly gift such that I may too have a story to tell.', 'I put my hand on his shoulder and, although he had lost the race, I told him of the last few days. I indulged him in the thoughts I was too insecure to tell anyone else, afraid that I would be incapable of articulating my thoughts into words so fervorous to inspire the same hurricane in their hearts. I spoke my thoughts with a fervorous hope of reigniting the bonfire of his own soul whose flames blazed into the heavens. It was too late, though. I was to be left huddling in the cold, rubbing my hands over my box of feeble matches whose fires fizzled as soon as they were lit.', '“I am so tired,” I said, “and I don’t really know what to do with my desire to stay awake. I don’t know what to do that’d make it worthwhile. What is the point of learning to love the present if in the present I only yearn to sleep? Without you, I feel hopeless in ever finding an answer.”', 'A cavity formed in George’s chest–an incorporeal chasm out which spilt a cold vapor and crept a ghostly hand that ascended into the air, cupped my chin, and twisted it to the door. <i>How could I be sad that George was gone when his other half was waiting on me?</i> There was an unexplored forest of mysteries where the Lebedev secret was still intact and kindling beneath the thickest of masks–a fire I could not afford to let die out, for only there could I forge an answer. And if there was one thing I learned about George, it was that if he wanted to do something, he would’ve done it unless he had a really good reason not to. I could not promise that I would live as he had and then walk out the door and not live as he had.', 'I slipped my hand off of George and exited into the hallway. The door thud shut behind me. Jenny was sitting in a chair with her arms wrapped around her tucked knees, staring as absently as the person I left. I walked to the base of the chair and rustled her hair. The strands were soft and thin like George’s. Her eyes climbed upward in short intervals until they met mine.', '“Do you want to stay here?” I asked her.', '“Where else is there to go?”', '“Come stay at my house for the night. Sleep in the guest room. Not next to a dusty vending machine.”', '“I don’t feel like moving,” she mumbled. “I don’t feel like doing anything.”', 'If I couldn’t bring to life the wants in my head after having all the motivation in the world to do so, then there was no right for me to expect a future where I would do it nor deserve such a future. Which meant even if treating her like a lost kitten was a terrible idea, and she screamed and wailed and demanded security kick me from the hospital and prevent me from seeing George ever again, it didn’t matter. What mattered was that I had the discipline not to be a disappointment.', 'I squatted down, cradled her into my arms, and picked her up, then carried her down the hall. Jenny didn’t flinch. She just continued her lifeless stare as she rested her head on my chest, her shirt  over my arms.', 'I set her in the passenger’s seat of my car and buckled in her seat belt. Then I got in the driver’s seat and began home. Were Jenny not with me, I surely would have crashed. The pounding of my heart kept my eyelids parted. The concern for the fragile flame kept me focused as she slept.', 'I gently bounced the car over the curb into the driveway and parked it so smoothly it didn’t feel like it stopped at all. When I picked up Jenny from the seat, she was like a child that pretended to be asleep when it was impossible they still were. I carried her upstairs to the guest room, its door opposite to mine. The moonlight illuminated the floor in the hallway to the guest room from the uncurtained window in my room, a lit trail I did not need lit for I knew it by heart.', 'I pulled the covers of the bed aside, laid her comfortably in the open space, then pulled the covers over her to make sure her fire kept warm. Then I returned downstairs to get a glass of water and back up again to place it on the bedside table. Finally, before leaving, I turned on the bedside lamp to a dim setting so she would not wake in darkness. I closed the door silently, the mechanism of the doorknob churning slightly as I let it twist close.', 'I moved into my own room directly across the hall, leaving my door open in case she needed me. I did not climb into my own bed but rather climbed onto the windowsill. My heart still pounded from carrying her up the stairs and my blood still boiled, staring out over the peaks of the trees into the city below with all its high-rises and bridges and street lights. Cars zipped through the sheets, planes blinked in the sky, and boats waded by the docks. Sports cars, private jets, and yachts. I never could have hated a place so much.', 'It wasn’t jealously. My family could afford the same stuff. It wasn’t undue contempt either—a single one of those needlessly luxurious items would have saved a family from falling apart. All of those things as a whole, and maybe the city wouldn’t need to split itself.', 'What was the difference between a one hundred thousand dollar car and a two hundred thousand dollar car? A smoother engine? Exotic leather seats? Did people seriously, in full heart and complete contemplation, believe those things worth more than someone’s life?', 'I previously thought myself to be better than them all in those regards. What happened that day proved otherwise—even I succumbed to placing a façade over the world to ignore what transpired around me. If I couldn’t do it, what right did I have to expect others to do it? The whole world was dreadful—every nook and cranny to my own soul deserved condemnation.', 'The door of the guestroom creaked open. Jenny wandered into my room and closed the door behind her. She tugged a thick blanket off my bed and dragged it to the windowsill. She climbed into the nook across from me and tossed the blanket into the air over us. As the blanket fell, our eyes caught sight of each other and she smiled, faintly. It was as if she came to show me that she was still unadulterated and good, that not all parts of the world were bad. But they were the parts of that were not to be loved by me.', 'We sat with our backs to the wall and our legs entangled beneath the blanket. I was worried the day would never end, but with her, it finally did.', 'End of Chapter'];
