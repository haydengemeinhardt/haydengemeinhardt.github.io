		chapter = ['Jenny’s phone rattled against the wood, its vibrations pinpointing its location beneath the blankets that twisted as Jenny scrambled to stop it. I squinted my eyes in the bright sun that loomed midday over our heads with hot rays that toasted us in the windowsill, putting us on display for the world to see if they ever looked up to the hills.', '“Hey Dad,” she said, her footsteps trailing out of the room. She shut the door of the guest room.', 'I rubbed my eyes and listened intently to the muffled bits of her half of the conversation: Mrs. Lebedev’s surgery was a success; she would stay to recover for a few days; Mr. Lebedev had landed at the airport and would be home soon; my inserted hand in their affairs was to be removed.', 'So be it. I pulled out my own phone and tried calling Lucas. No sooner did it go to voicemail before Jenny walked out and said with a voice light like a half-yawn, “Can you drop me off at the hospital so I can get my car?”', 'Then after a moment of silence, she said, “is that… okay?”', '“Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, sorry,” I said and threw off the blanket. ', 'I didn’t mean to gawk. It was just that she said it so… rationally. As in, she had this task to be done, thought of a means to do the task, and set out to do it. No thinking, no feeling, just doing. Just existing. Not living. How could the two of us be so lifeless? George had more excitement on a Tuesday afternoon.', 'I grabbed my keys, stepped into sandals, and drove, begrudgingly, to the hospital. I waved her goodbye in the parking lot and called Lucas again. With no answer, I drove to his house next. No music, podcasts, nor thoughts drained the vibrations of the car. I was almost as lifeless as to gripe about potholes and honk at minor inconveniences.', 'The length of Lucas’s driveway was barren. The only light was that of the sun squeezing through the large back-side windows and out the front. The doorbell echoed throughout the house; no one answered its ping. I rang it again, and again, and again, to the point that an answer would be tremendously awkward. But I had no one else to be with except Lucas, and nowhere else to go except to loiter at his doorstep, and nothing else to do than ring his doorbell in repetition as one does lazily bouncing a ball against the wall. ', 'Standing on the path alone, I could see how desolate it was, how lost I was trying to retrace George’s steps, how far I had wandered astray the highway toward the sea in search of that voyage. Only then did I realize my disconnect to society, built up like a coming tsunami after an earthquake. I was blind to the warning that was the retreat of the water, instead exploring the newly revealed sediment in its wake and spitting upon Lucas for not joining me. But the day turned dark. A shadow was cast upon the beach by a wave that blocked out the sun, a great cliff I once stood upon. I could see my old self staring down below. I waved my arms in warning for them to stay away, but it was too dark. It was too late.', 'I was a vagrant to society. I was an outcast pushed just far enough from the tree line that I could finally see the forest instead of fiddling in awe amongst the individual trees, flowers, bushes, and overgrown roots. I could see what people really were. My awe turned to rot: humans were still just another species of animal in the chain of evolution, and I had the unfortunate circumstance of being born just too early.', 'It was only meagerly dreadful—disappointing. It finally manifested itself as it does in everyone at some point, when our feet sink into the damp sand and in our slumber it cements around us, so that when death barrels forth, we have no choice but to accept it.', 'I once thought myself young and able to catch it early, like waiting for a mosquito to inevitably land on my arm before smacking it dead. How audacious to think myself able to simply escape the grip of nihilism, to outrun the outrageous beast before me.', 'A woman slammed shut the door of a car across the street. She pulled away in a rush, leaving an empty driveway in an empty street at a house as empty as the one behind me gleaming like a gem on a shallow beach.', 'I knew what was expected of me: I was to return home, lay in bed, grieve George, then file back into routine. I was to honor him by writing about him in my statement of purpose and using him as an identity to get pity laid—and perhaps I would. But I was to never dare step further. ', 'Society shaped me to respect its boundaries—very strict boundaries that let them live boring lives. Yet, I had learned that they didn’t care about anyone else beyond their own convenience. ', 'Who were they to demand my unreciprocated respect? Fuck them, their norms, their wonts, their self-worship, and their narrowed, forever turning world. I skipped in pep and imprudence down the steps and across the street.', 'I ascended the patio stairs and peered in through the windows by the front door, forming a cove with my hands to block the glare. There was no security system nor camera in sight. I rang the doorbell and waited. When no one answered, I put one hand to the door and the other to the knob. When I turned my hand, the knob turned with it, and I swung the door open and let the cool air breeze past me.', '"Show yourself now or forever hold your peace," I mumbled. ', 'No dogs barked, no doors creaked, no chairs squeaked, nor couches groaned, so I stepped inside and shut the door behind me. ', 'What was the senseless boundary, and how could I have ever taken it seriously? No one had seen me, and no one would ever know. It was like stealing gum from a millionaire—an action so inconsequential it didn’t deserve the thought and was best left to the moralists like law is left to lawyers. I was living a life that transcended such ethical questions, for my chest ignited in excitement. The world had sprung with the colors of a cherry blossom tree and swayed to the tune of an opulent orchestra. ', 'But beneath the stubborn shadow of the wave and in its deafening roar, the world ultimately remained bleak. It would not be so easily avoided. ', 'I took a deep breath and braced my back against the heavy wooden door. The wave drained the oxygen from the room, wrung the thrill from my heart, then splintered the door into a thousand meaningless pieces, leaving me to float in its infinite limbo.', '--', 'Two days passed in a blur before I returned to school, and hardly two steps through the front doors was granted before I was escorted to Principal Fritz’s office. So, the identity had indeed been thrust upon me—I was that kid. But an entirely different identity had already rooted itself in my heart in the two days off. I was plucked from the herd and forever struck with the mark of an alien; a heretic and a dissident and a vagrant; a no good egomaniac who thought himself to be in a world of insentient beings with no care other than that of their own subconscious desires.', 'Fritz’s office was bare. Behind him were walls of glass blocked by black, plastic blinds angled to let only light in and no wavering eyes grasping as becoming king or queen of the day’s gossip. Nothing furnished the room other than his heavy oak desk, a bookshelf of file storage boxes, and a large fern in the corner. It was enough to make it feel like an office, but he could leave at any moment, and no one would’ve known it was ever occupied.', 'He sat with perfect posture in a large, leather chair behind his desk, while Lucas and I sat on plastic stools with metal legs. Everything about his office shouted he was in charge, while who he was almost remained a mystery. Even the title upon his desk read in bold, golden letters “Principal” without “Fritz” appended to the end.', '“How are you two?” he asked, his hands folded on top of his desk.', '“Fine,” I muttered.', 'Lucas laughed and kicked back. “Yeah, that about sums it up.”', 'Fritz nodded with approval. “I wanted to remind you two that there are resources we can provide to help you.”', '“Like what?” I blurted.', 'Fritz clearly did not know the next step in the line of formalities, hesitating to make his move in the opening variation I played. He thought for a moment, then lifted his fingers and counted off, “We have a counselor on campus that you can visit at any time. We have programs in place to help students like yourselves deal with the difficult period of your lives. We can even direct you to other outside resources.” He smiled with three fingers raised. What, did he think it was checkmate in two? Redirect me to a pencil-pushing counselor and prescribe me with a low dose of Prozac?', '“I also wanted to give you two a heads up,” Fritz said, “the student council has put together a memorial in the hall for George yesterday after school.”', 'I spat the air from my mouth.', '“We appreciate it, Mr. Fritz,” said Lucas.', 'I darted my eyes to Lucas. “We?”', '“Would you rather pretend nothing happened?”', '“Why would George want a memorial?”', 'Fritz stepped in, “Mickey, it’s not for George. It’s for his peers—including you—to acknowledge that he is no longer with us, to mourn his loss, and hopefully find closure. I know it hurts, but now’s the time that we grieve.”', 'He spoke, but I had already tuned out the conversation. Shortly thereafter, we left back into the halls where eyes poked at us. I walked right past the memorial swarmed by mosquitoes sucking the last blood from the carcass, modern pagans who only worshipped idols when it was convenient for them to do so.*', 'When we reached my locker, Lucas whispered, “What do you have against a memorial?”', 'I sighed. “Not the memorial itself. But that it was established so we could all blindly pose with it on our way to class. It’s a disgrace.”', '“We don’t own a monopoly on this.”', '“You know what I mean,” I said. “They act like it is some school festivity. It’s not their loss. It’s not their story.”', 'I fumbled with my padlock trying to jerk it open as quickly as I could. I did not like being in the hall with so many people staring at me.', '“It sucks,” Lucas blurted, “I know. I get it. I don’t want to argue with you. I want to grieve with you, then start taking steps forward because I can’t take this anymore. I need this. We need this. You know we do. Life is moving forward whether we like it or not and it is best we don’t let it drag us along through mud and rain with a rope around our neck. If we fall off, it’ll be hell getting back on because it won’t stop and no one will look back for us.”', '“How can you and everyone else be so logical about this?” I asked. “This isn’t some five step textbook problem. Our best friend—” my voice trailed, catching some Freudian slip. I was going to say “died” but George didn’t die. Although, what was the memorial for? Why was everyone talking about grieving George? Why was it such a big deal to everyone? Time slowed down. “George is still alive, right?”', '“Oh, Mickey, you didn’t know?”', '“Know what? What do I not know?”', 'Lucas shook his head and looked away.', 'I gripped his shirt. “Tell me!”', 'He did not have to. He knew he did not. ', 'Had he been too busy typing “Fly high, George!” in his bio with everyone else to let me know? I shoved him into the backs of a group next to us and forced my way through the hall, squeezing through the doors against a flow of lower classmen from the last arriving bus. ', 'Was that Samantha I passed? She had no siblings and both of her parents worked. I got into my car and drove to her house.', 'End of Chapter'];
