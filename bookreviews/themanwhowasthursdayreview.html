<p>
“Because I am afraid of him,” said Syme; “And no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard Gaya on goodreads.com put it in better words than I can:
</p>
<p>
“Possibly the shortest way to describe Chesterton’s famous novel is to say that it is Alice's Adventures in Wonderland for grownups.”
</p>
<p>
It is hard to describe the book without diving into spoilers, but you get into exciting action very quickly. From there, the plot starts to feel a bit underwhelming once the realization of the general course of things kicks in. Many times I wanted to skip through the pages of opioid-induced imagery (of which felt excessive for my taste) because I knew what was up next.
</p>
<p>
Yet, in the end, I never regret reading the story, despite not thoroughly enjoying many of its chapters. It’s a story of compounding “wtf did I just read”. In the beginning, I reread pages over because I did not fully understand what was going on, but I don’t think you’re ever supposed to.
</p>
<p>
His style of writing is skillful and is not meant for a novice reader. Mixed in with the deranged plot, and it is easy to get lost.
</p>
<p>
I’d give this book a 3/6, though it will strangely always hold a place in my mind when I glance at it on the shelf. For a quick fix, the first three chapters are quite enjoyable. Maybe you'll be intrigued to read further as I did.
