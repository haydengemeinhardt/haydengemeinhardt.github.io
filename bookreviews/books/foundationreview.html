							<h1>Foundation by Isaac Asimov</h1><br>

<p>Fun fact: the Foundation Trilogy beat Lord of The Rings as “Best All Time Series”</p>
<p>I absolutely loved many ideas presented in this book that have greatly influenced my writing style regarding the Martian Barber, while simultaneously peaking at other books on my shelf due to the dull nature of the story at times.</p>
<p>Foundation (book one of the trilogy) is a collection of four short stories, each spread a few decades apart with new characters and a new plotline loosely connected to the main plot. Each section either hints at or portrays a “crisis” and how the characters manage to work around it. </p>
<p>Almost every main character is witty in their own way, which makes them extremely interesting to listen to. However, the first main character almost feels like a “Harry Potter”, or a MC that is bland so the reader can fit into their shoes, while being introduced to the setting, so the book comes off with a weak start. Additionally, while each character is interesting, you only have a brief time with them before being introduced to someone new, so the connections to the characters are not fully developed. The trader in the shortest story is a great example of someone I loved but only got a handful of pages with.</p>
<p>When it comes to the crisis, or the climax of each story in the heat of the moment, Asimov does a masterful job at keeping me reeled in. Better than any book I have read so far. Those moments are the reason I push through the trivial chapters one by one.</p>
<p>Then again, the climax can only last so long. Those beginning or intermediate transitional chapters that are only a couple of pages long feel unnecessary, almost like developing a complex plot that, in the end, will only have a handful of pages to play out. It reminds me a lot of Avengers Endgame in that they spent half of the movie developing plots, and consequently the plots aren’t as explored as one would hope. Why spend five pages explaining the political climate each story if it’s all going to be resolved at the end of the crisis as though the politics were extraneous anyway? Despite different ideas being used to solve the crises, it felt like the same cookie cutter outline reused each time to give the main characters a personal stake in the crisis.</p>
<p>It’s understandable to an extent. A writer cannot depend on the main motive of a character to be “save the world”, especially not five times in a row. There needs to be a personal stake, which is why you see every Marvel hero have a loved one of some sort in danger as a subplot while saving the world. But, just like Marvel, reusing that same subplot gets just as boring real fast. If there’s no interest to the fictional world being saved, or the chemistry in the relationship, or the political landscape, then it’s a waste of time. That’s why I loved the trader so much. Despite it being a cheesy “all I care about is money” character, it was something different and well written.</p>
<p>Now, with all of that said, the book has an expertly crafted pace, amazing exposition, and a serious and mature plot that is a must for anyone in the genre who appreciates such things.  The plot itself transitions into our real world so seamlessly one could consider it a study into sociology.</p>
<p>I give this book a 5/6, with plans to read the second in the series.</p>
