	Quantum Computing For Everyone—except it’s not actually for everyone. And I don’t mean that in a pretentious way, as learning the math skills necessary to comprehend it isn’t too hard of a task. But this book will give headaches! Matrixes are a real pain! He did leave out complex numbers to appeal to everyone, which I’m not sure how hard of a task that was though I can’t believe it was easy, so he at least tried.</p><p>	Still, I read this in little over a week, probably the fastest I have read any book. I was extremely excited to learn about quantum computing and this seemed to be the best book to introduce me to it (and I still think so). Admittingly, I had to reread the math multiple times to even comprehend what was going on. And also admittingly, it’s been a couple of months since I read it as I lent it to a friend, so I would have to study up on it once more. However! I think the book laid out the math very well (not overly thorough like most textbooks, and not skipping massive steps like… most textbooks haha), so it wouldn’t take me long to get back into it. This book probably taught me the equivalent of what would have taken an entire course in a matter of a week or so. Granted, I have added benefit of coming in with a computer engineering background, so it made me appreciate the book so much more.</p><p>	My favorite idea described in the book, and I’m probably an outlier in this, is the quantum gates (Pauli gates, Hadamard gate, Toffoli gate, Fredkin gate). These ideas are introduced after over a hundred pages of explanations and linear algebra, so it’s hard to talk about them in a review. On a much bigger picture, though, is the idea that classical computing (such as basic logic gates) is a subarea of quantum computing, in that all of classical computing can be done with quantum computers but not vice versa. </p><p>	My second favorite is Einstein’s idea that “God does not play dice”. In other words, despite our inability to understand quantum mechanics and how it fits into the world, Einstein still believes there is some underlying law regarding it all to fit into physics today. In the same way that flipping a coin isn’t entirely random, that if you knew all the variables (force of the flip, height from ground, etc.) you can calculate which side the coin will land on. It’s not entirely the same in quantum mechanics (at least, for now).</p><p>	To put this into perspective: there was an experiment performed by scientists Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach in which they sent silver atoms between a north magnet on bottom and (stronger) south magnet on top to measure the axis alignment of its atoms. If the silver atom is aligned so the north magnetic field is on top and south is on bottom, then the stronger south magnet on top will win and pull the atom up. From a classical viewpoint, the magnetic poles could be aligned in any direction (45 degrees, 55, 65, 67, etc.), so there would be a continuous line along the resulting screen. However, there were only two points: at the top extreme and the bottom extreme, as if all atoms were aligned perfectly one way or the other. (Note Bernhardt says you can’t actually measure electron spin using this method, but the representation will do for our simplified purpose).</p><p>	Now, if you then add a second step where you measure in the horizontal direction so the magnets are on the lateral sides, things get interesting. And things get random!  Exactly half of the electrons with spin N in the vertical direction will have spin N in the horizontal direction and the other half will have spin S in the horizontal direction. Same with S in the vertical direction. It is completely random. This is where Einstein’s quote can come into play. We have yet to find any underlying variables to determine the randomness. So, for now, God does play with dice, and there’s no way to determine if that will ever change.</p><p>	Even better, if you then repeat the vertical measurement as a third step, the vertical measurement is again completely random, despite you knowing the measurement before hand! For example, if you measure in the vertical direction over and over, you will get the same answer (say NNN). If you then measure in the horizontal direction and then the vertical direction again, the answer will not necessarily stay as NNN! What may have originally been an N measurement now may read as an S measurement. In other words, taking the measurement in the horizontal direction had some effect on taking the measurement in the vertical direction. For example, if you measure N in the vertical, measure in the horizontal, then take the vertical measurement again, that vertical measurement may change to S.</p><p>	As for how all of this plays into real-world scenarios… well, that’s still being developed decades after the idea of quantum computing emerged. It’s really a matter of waiting on engineering to make it possible, as any slight affect from the environment can mess up the computer. And there’s a lot of debate around the hype of quantum computing. A lot of people believe it is extremely over hyped and will only be used in specific situations. That although n qubits can simulate 2^n normal bits, it’s only in perfectly formulated scenarios that we can even harness a fraction of those bits. That easily manipulating 72 qubit entanglements is a hazy dream with any tech within the next century. Others believe, as Chris Bernhardt, that quantum computing will be the next big leap forward in technology. “Once quantum computers have more than 72 or so qubits we will enter the age of quantum supremacy—when quantum computers can do computations that are beyond the ability of any classical computer” (page 187). I’d align myself with the former sentiment, though it’s no doubt this is an interesting topic as our physical engineering capabilities are catching up to the point where we can truly start experimenting with real-world data instead of pure theoretical equations.</p><p>	For 200 pages, this book sure does a good job at baseline introducing me to quantum computing. I haven’t had this much fun with a book in a long time, as I literally nerded out to any engineering friend I knew after finishing it.</p><p>I’m giving this book a 5/6. However, I don’t recommend it to everyone, unless that everyone encompasses my peers in engineering.
