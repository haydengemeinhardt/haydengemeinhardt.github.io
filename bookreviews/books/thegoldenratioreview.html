	“[As] Richard Buckminster Fuller once put it: ‘When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only of how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.’” (page 10)</p><p>	A history of the number Phi. Likely one of the only numbers you could write an entire book on regarding its history.</p><p>	And that’s exactly what the book focused on: the history. Perhaps it was a bit ignorant of me to go into it expecting a full, in-depth study of the number. There certainly were many interesting topics, but first it’s important to point out that’s not what the book is about.</p><p>	Surprisingly enough, a large part of the book focused more on debunking different ideas on where phi appears throughout the world, such as art or architecture. I honestly was expecting this book to overly exaggerate phi’s relation with such things, so it was a nice relief to see the author wasn’t taking a dishonest path. Still, I found all the excess information about every painter/musician discussed to be about the equivalent of scraping the first two lines off of Wikipedia. It felt like fluff.</p><p>	Too much of the book was centered around debunking various claims on the use of phi in art/poetry/music/whatever. Half of them were clearly far-fetched, others no more than number play a middle-schooler could do. The type of claims no one really takes seriously. Some were good, most were lackluster.</p><p>	Now, enough about complaints! </p><p>	Livio seemed to be absolutely obsessed with 5 names throughout: Pythagoreas, Plato, Fibonacci, Euler, and Kepler (and Roger Penrose).</p><p>I absolutely loved the section regarding the history of Pythagoras and his followers. I had no idea he had his own little gang of people causing havoc in mathematics! </p><p>Pythagoreans believed/followed many ideas some would relate to a cult following that I instead found quite cute. For one, they characterized odd numbers as male attributes, and also light and goodness, “They associated with the odd numbers male attributes and, rather prejudiciously, also light and goodness, while they gave the even numbers female attributes and associated with them darkness and even” (page 31).</p><p>Now, the reason I bring this up is because of his use of “prejudiciously”. The association of females with chaos existed long before Pythagoras was ever around, and perhaps Livio knew of this when he used that term. I’m not sure, but the term carries a strong negative connotation with it, which I believe is a misunderstanding of the associations. In a nutshell, order/society, or the patriarchy, is symbolically masculine and chaos/nature is symbolically feminine, the opposition to the patriarchy and the thing from which order rises (which is chaos). There’s a long rabbit hole to go down, but it’s simply a fundamental association that is by no means degrading of women in any mature interpretation (You may notice this is coming from my reading of 12 Rules For Life which a lot of people hate and understandably so, but this idea isn’t Peterson’s).</p><p>The Pythagoreans “also attributed special properties to some individual numbers”. 1 is for uniqueness, and is the generator of all numbers and thus not considered a number itself. 2 is for polarity (two sides), 3 for for harmony, 4 for space/matter, 5 for love (2+3). 6 is a perfect number “Not because God created the world in 6 days; rather, the contrary is true” as stated by St. Augustine. 10 is the number of everything, as it combines 1+2+3+4=10. Of course, you can go deeper, but even this outline is something I might implement in my life just for fun.</p><p>(Speaking of fun) Fun fact: The Babylonians discovered “Pythagorean triples” before Pythagoreas with the equation (even though they used words instead of equations like we do) p^2-q^2; 2pq; p^2+q^2. It wasn’t until Pythagoras formulated the theorem that all right angles were characterized.</p><p>	I wasn’t expecting Plato to have such an impact on Phi, but after learning about Platonic solids, it’s no wonder. Platonic solids are “the only existing solids in which all the faces are identical and equilateral, and each of the solids can be circumscribed by a sphere (with all its vertices lying on the sphere)” (page 67). Each of these shapes are related closely to Phi.</p><p>	Fibonacci was the obvious mention with his sequence 1,1,2,3,5,8,13…, or each term is the sum of the two previous terms. In connection to Phi, each term divided by the previous term (2/1,3/2,4/3,…) converges to Phi. If you write out the original equation, you’ll see how this is the case. You also find that if you add an odd number of products of successive numbers, you get the square of the last number used (ex: 1x1+1x2+2x3 = 3^2). There are numerous other tricks associated with it.</p><p>	Kepler had tried to formulate his original theory about the revolution of planets. At the time, only 6 planets were known, and he determined it was because there were 5 Platonic solids (with 6 spacings in between). As such, he tried to formulate a (Copernicus) model of the solar system around these solids. It was absolutely wrong, but Owen Gingerich states, “Seldom in history has so wrong a book been so seminal in directing the future course of science” (page 148), since it created a mathematical model for the universe. Kepler later went on to discover the first two laws of planetary motion named after him. He also strained to calculate Mars’ orbit, dubbed “my warfare with Mars”, that some believe signifies the birth of modern science (page 150).</p><p>	And later, after much debunking, Livio decides “we should, in my humble opinion, give up its application as a fixed standard for aesthetics, either in the human form or as a touchstone for the fine arts” (page 200) and that “the Golden Ratio is a product of humanly invented geometry” (page 253).</p><p>	You may be wondering why I just covered the entire book in the review? Two reasons:</p><p>1.	To take personal note of its important contents</p><p>2.	So you can save your time from reading it</p><p>I give this book a 3/6. It had it’s interesting moments, I loved how it wasn’t overly exaggerated, and now I have better insight into the foundations of Phi. But I can’t say I would ever recommend it to anyone.
